  /* FULL WINDOW, titlebar included. A dialog is a takeover: dimming everything
     except a strip across the top left the chrome looking like it belonged to
     something else, and a panel centred in the remainder sat visibly low.
     The trade is that the Hub owns minimize/maximize/close and the drag region
     (decorations:false), so none of them can be clicked while a dialog is up.
     That is deliberate and it is why every dialog carries its own dismissal --
     Escape plus a Cancel button or the sheet's X -- and why Tab is trapped in
     the panel rather than allowed to wander into unreachable chrome.
     The radius matches .app so the scrim cannot square off the window corners
     if rounding is ever actually visible (it needs transparent:true). */
