// =============================================================================
// Task 12 (plan-b comparator): THE IN-PROCESS HALF OF THE GATE.
//
// THE HONEST SPLIT, stated here too because this is the file where it is easy
// to forget: this case renders through the real NRI frame graph (device ->
// NriDevice::Wrap -> NriGraphContext::CreateOffscreen -> RenderFrameOffscreen
// -> ReadCapture, the exact vehicle NriGraphPixelTest.cpp's PixelVehicle
// builds) and compares the result against a committed PNG with
// Arcane::CompareImages at a ZERO budget. That is ALL it proves. This exe
// links neither RuntimeApp nor EditorApp, so a green run here says NOTHING
// about boot, settle, --report, --compare/--bless, or the CLI -- scripts/
// golden-gate.ps1, which launches the real hosts, is the gate that covers
// that half. Do not let this case stand in for that script, and do not let a
// change here be read as evidence either host still works.
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT COMPARE AGAINST ReferenceProject/Verify/References/
// runtime-scene.png, even though that is the file Step 1 of this task's own
// brief blessed and named: that PNG is the REAL ArcaneRuntime.exe host's
// capture of ReferenceProject/Content/scenes/main.arcscene, and reproducing
// it here is not just tedious, it is IMPOSSIBLE for this exe to attempt
// honestly, for reasons specific to this project, not a general excuse:
//   * that scene's PostProcess volume, its "PulseBox" sprite (a
//     TIME-VARYING material -- its rest appearance is whatever the real
//     host's --settle loop happened to converge to, not a fixed fact this
//     exe could ever recompute) and its MeshCube all reference material/
//     mesh/sprite GUIDs resolved out of ReferenceProject/Content/, and nothing
//     under Content/ is staged beside ArcaneTests.exe -- only
//     ReferenceProject/Verify/ is (premake5.lua's ArcaneTests postbuild
//     COPYDIR; Content/ is never named there, unlike ArcaneRuntime's and
//     ArcaneEditor's own {COPYDIR} of the WHOLE ReferenceProject/), so this
//     exe cannot even OPEN those assets, let alone shade them identically;
//   * every real host frame ALSO carries the debug HUD (RuntimeFrame.cpp's
//     BuildHud: an "ArcaneRuntime" ImGui window, unconditionally, in every
//     build config, in both windowed and --headless runs) baked into the
//     same captured pixels -- confirmed by this very task's Finding A, which
//     is why runtime-scene needed a backend-specific override at all. That
//     window's code lives in ArcaneRuntime/src/ (the .exe's OWN sources,
//     per premake5.lua's `files` glob for that project), not in ArcaneClient,
//     so it is not merely unstaged here, it is not LINKED here.
// Comparing this case's readback against that PNG would therefore either
// require duplicating RuntimeApp's scene resolution, its post chain and its
// HUD by hand inside a test file (forking the exact "parallel infrastructure"
// this codebase's own directional rule warns against), or loosening the
// budget until the resulting wall of differences vanished -- and this task's
// own constraints forbid the second outright. So this case renders content it
// CAN fully author and own, and compares against a SEPARATE, equally real,
// committed reference this task blesses for exactly that content:
// ReferenceProject/Verify/References/inprocess-lit-cube.png. It is still a
// zero-budget CompareImages of a real GPU capture against a real committed
// PNG -- the render-path proof the honest split promises -- just not a
// disguised, unreliable attempt at host parity.
//
// ONE BACKEND ONLY (D3D12), deliberately: whether the two backends agree
// pixel-for-pixel is the reference HIERARCHY's own question (Tasks 6-7 and
// this task's own Step 1 dance over runtime-scene/editor-ui), answered at the
// host level where a real divergence gets a real backend-specific override.
// Re-litigating that question for a second, unrelated scene here would only
// duplicate that mechanism inside a file that has no reference hierarchy of
// its own -- one plain PNG, one backend, on purpose.
