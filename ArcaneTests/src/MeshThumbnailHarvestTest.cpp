//                                (final-review C1's net), on scratch fixtures.
//   2. [gpu][thumbs][golden]  -- the THUMBNAIL GOLDEN SET (F2c debts arc, Task
//                                E): five real ReferenceProject subjects
//                                through ONE harvester, ImageCompared at budget
//                                0 against committed references, with a
//                                re-bless mode. Its own header block, far
//                                below, carries the decision record and the
//                                bless procedure.
//
// They live side by side deliberately (the decision record's first decision):
// "does harvest #2 draw harvest #1's geometry" and "does harvest #1 look right"
// are two halves of one question over one class, and splitting them across
// files is how they drift.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Mesh-ASSET thumbnail harvesting, on a real adapter -- final-review C1's net.
//
// WHY THIS IS A [gpu] CASE AND NOT A DEVICE-LESS ONE: the bug lives entirely in
// the render half. MaterialPreviewHarvester::Harvest stashes the resolved
// geometry, names a guid on the MeshInstances, and hands both to a real
// NriGraphContext whose NriMeshBufferCache caches BY GUID and consults the
// supply only on a MISS. There is no seam between "which guid the instances
// name" and "which buffers get bound" short of the device, so the only honest
// instrument is the picture.
//
// THE ASSERTION IS A CONTROL, NOT "the two pictures differ". Two different
// meshes produce different pictures even WITH the bug, because FrameMeshBounds
// re-frames the camera per asset -- so "differs" proves nothing. Instead the
// cube is harvested twice: once on a vehicle that has seen nothing else, and
// once as the SECOND harvest on a vehicle that already holds another mesh's
// residency. Those two pictures must be identical. Under the pre-fix code
// (every mesh harvested under one session-fixed 'MESH' guid) the second harvest
// HIT the sphere's resident buffers and drew the first 36 of the sphere's
// indices, so the two cube pictures differed.
//
// The two fixtures are chosen to share an AABB on purpose -- BuildCube(1.0f) and
// BuildUvSphere(0.5f, ...) both span [-0.5, 0.5]^3 (MeshAsset.cpp's unit rule) --
// so FrameMeshBounds hands both harvests the SAME camera and the picture is a
// function of the geometry alone.

// =============================================================================
// THE THUMBNAIL GOLDEN SET (F2c debts arc, Task E)
//
// Decision record: docs/research/2026-09-15-thumbnail-golden-lane-research.md
// (its section 2 is this case's spec, decision by decision). Evidence:
// ...-thumbnail-golden-internal-research.md (this repo's machinery) and
// .superpowers/sdd/2026-09-15-f2c-debts-arc/spike-64px-imagecompare.md (the
// comparator, measured at 64x64 before a single reference was committed).
//
// WHAT IS PINNED, AND AT WHICH SURFACE. The bytes compared here are the ones
// MaterialPreviewHarvester itself writes to `thumbnailDir` -- its OWN 64x64
// offscreen capture, never a crop of a panel screenshot and never a host
// window. That invariant is decision 5 and it is deliberate: the editor shell
// (editor-ui.png) is a shared, layout-volatile slot that gets re-blessed every
// time a panel moves, and a per-asset rendering property hidden inside such a
// capture can be laundered into the new reference by any layout re-bless. The
// harvester needs no host boot to answer "does this asset still render right"
// -- an OffscreenVehicle plus hand-filled Services is the whole vehicle -- so
// this is an in-process render-path case, exactly like GoldenImageTest.cpp's
// lit cube, and exactly NOT a golden-gate.ps1 lane.
//
// ONE HARVESTER, FIVE SUBJECTS, ONE CASE. This is not tidiness. The C1 bug
// class was "the second harvest through a shared vehicle draws the FIRST's
// geometry" (residency cached by guid under a session-fixed synthetic id), and
// a set that stood each subject up in its own harvester could never catch it.
// All five go through one instance, one queue, one preview vehicle -- mesh
// after material after mesh -- so cross-subject contamination surfaces as a
// picture that does not match its own reference.
//
// NAME-KEYED, NOT CONTENT-HASH-KEYED (decision 6). No hashing anywhere here:
// at budget 0 a refactor that leaves pixels unchanged already passes and a
// changed asset already fails loudly, whereas hash-keyed reference names would
// turn "the asset changed" from a red compare into a silent missing-reference
// refusal. The content-hash idea belongs to the harvester's runtime CACHE
// (PrimeFromDisk's mtime-only staleness check), which is its own follow-on.
//
// D3D12 ONLY, one committed set, for GoldenImageTest.cpp's stated reason:
// whether the two backends agree pixel-for-pixel is the reference HIERARCHY's
// question, answered at the host level where a real divergence earns a real
// backend override. The resolution rule below still honours a
// thumbs/<backend>/<name>.png override if one is ever blessed -- it is the
// hierarchy that is reused, not the second backend that is claimed.
//
// ===== BUDGET 0, AND THE ONE FAILURE SHAPE THAT IS EXPECTED ==========
// CompareImages at the library default: no ImageCompareOptions, no
// maxDiffPixels, no maxDiffPixelRatio. The spike measured this at 64x64 on
// these very fixtures: identical -> match; a section recolour or a 1px content
// shift -> a clean fail that the antialiasing cascade never swallows; a
// single +-8-on-one-channel pixel -> absorbed below the dE94 JND. Sound for
// everything this set exists to catch.
//
// It is NOT sound against a UNIFORM BRIGHTNESS LIFT, and that is stated here
// rather than papered over with a budget. A +1 lift is absorbed; a +4 lift --
// visually indistinguishable -- fails catastrophically (73% of golden_prop's
// pixels), because a flat-shaded region has zero 3x3 variance BEFORE and AFTER
// the lift, and the comparator short-circuits zero-variance windows to "cannot
// be antialiasing, therefore a real difference" without ever reaching SSIM. A
// 64px render of a shaded prop or sphere is mostly flat-shaded region, so that
// short-circuit dominates. CONSEQUENCE, SAID PLAINLY: a tonemap/exposure arc
// (the north star's T5/T6) is EXPECTED to fail this whole set, and the right
// response is to LOOK at the diffs and RE-BLESS -- not to raise a budget, which
// would also silently swallow a real scattered regression of the same size.
//
// ===== RE-BLESSING, THE WHOLE PROCEDURE =============================
// The renderer is about to move every lit pixel here (T1's GGX cutover, then
// T5/T6/T3-lite), so this set ships with the mechanism its template never had:
// GoldenImageTest.cpp's lit cube has been re-blessed exactly zero times since
// 2026-08-26 and has no way to be.
//
//   1. ARCANE_THUMBS_BLESS=1 ./ArcaneTests.exe "[thumbs][golden]"
//        -- writes each harvested PNG over its reference in the SOURCE tree
//           (<repo>/ReferenceProject/Verify/References/thumbs/...), at the
//           level the reference resolved from, logging one line per file.
//           Nothing is compared on a bless run.
//   2. Rebuild Arcane.slnx so ArcaneTests' postbuild restages Verify/ beside
//      the exe (the compare reads the STAGED copy, not the source one).
//   3. ./ArcaneTests.exe "[thumbs][golden]"   -- no env var. Must be green.
//   4. git diff --stat, then OPEN THE PNGs. A reference nobody looked at is
//      not a reference.
//   5. Commit.
//
// SCOPE IS THE CATCH2 FILTER, deliberately -- one case name re-blesses that
// case's subjects, "[thumbs][golden]" re-blesses the set, and there is no bulk
// overwrite outside the filter. The switch is an environment variable rather
// than a CLI flag only because Catch2 owns the command line here; the semantics
// (opt-in, explicit, writes at the resolved level, never flattens a backend
// override) are the host's own --bless rule.
