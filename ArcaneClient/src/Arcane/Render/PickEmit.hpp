// PickEmit: the CPU "which entities are pickable" seam for GPU entity-id
// picking (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-arcane-entity-id-picking-design.md,
// SS3b/3c). CollectPickables walks the registry for pickable entities (sprites,
// physics colliders, meshes) and appends one PickDrawable per pickable shape,
// in WORLD space, ready for the id pass. The k-th appended drawable (0-based)
// gets hit-proxy id k+1; PickEntityForId inverts that mapping (id 0 == background).
//
// Pure, device-less-testable: no GPU, no render device, and -- since F4 (spec
// s7.1) -- NO VIEW. The emitter knows nothing about the camera: sprites are the four
// world corners SpriteWorldQuad places, physics silhouettes are world shapes in
// metres at the body pose, meshes are a world matrix + the asset guid. The id
// pass (Render/Nri/nodes/PickOutlineNodes.hpp's PickNode) projects all of it
// through the frame's ViewTransform (NriGraphContext::FrameDesc::pickView), so
// the same drawables pick correctly under an orthographic 2D view, a tilted
// one or a perspective one. The orthographic-only view struct that carried
// plan 1's per-axis pixel mapping into the emitter is gone (ABI 33).

    // ORDERING (this IS the hit-proxy id assignment: id = index+1):

    //      DRAWN set, RenderSystems.hpp's own filter, in the registry's view
    //      iteration order (archetype-stable). One Quad per entity whose
    //      corners are SpriteWorldQuad(world matrix, the sprite ASSET's base
    //      size, its pivot) -- the SpriteTable resolves both exactly as
    //      submission does (1x1 m at the centre pivot when unresolved) -- so
    //      the silhouette is the drawn quad under ANY projection, a mirrored
    //      or off-centre pivot included.
    //   2. Colliders -- one PickDrawable per Fixture, iterated via an
    //      archetype-stable View<Collider2D, PhysicsBodyRef> (DETERMINISTIC:
    //      the id assignment id=index+1 must not depend on unordered_map hash
    //      order -- the same rule PhysicsSystem's create pass follows). The body
    //      pose comes from the live PhysicsWorld via PhysicsBodyRef::handle;
    //      fixture dims + local offset are scaled by PhysicsBodyRef::appliedScale
    //      so a scaled body's silhouette matches its drawn collider. Physics
    //      colliders are read via registry.GetResource<PhysicsResource>(); if
    //      absent (no physics world on this registry), none are collected --
    //      not an error.
    //   3. Meshes    -- View<WorldTransform, MeshRenderer, Not<Hidden>>, resolved
    //      through the registry's MeshTable; a nil, unresolved or EMPTY mesh
    //      (no sections) emits nothing, exactly what GpuSceneSync
    //      (Render/GpuSceneSync.hpp) stages. ONE drawable per entity
    //      whatever its section count: sections carry materials, not identity.
    //
    // THE ORDER RULE FOR THE ID PASS (spec s7.1): the 2D kinds draw first with
    // the depth test OFF in submission order (later wins, so a collider picks
    // over an underlying sprite), then the meshes draw depth-tested against a
    // cleared depth -- so a mesh always owns a pixel it shares with a sprite,
    // and meshes resolve among themselves by depth: the main pass's order.
