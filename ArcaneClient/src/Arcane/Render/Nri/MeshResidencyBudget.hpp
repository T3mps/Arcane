// MeshResidencyBudget -- the POLICY half of NriMeshBufferCache (spec s7.2 / R2),
// split out DEVICE-FREE so the eviction rule is provable without an NRI device at
// all. Same split NriTextureCache::Bc7RowPitch keeps for the same reason: the
// arithmetic that decides what happens is testable independently of the API that
// carries it out.
//
// ONE COMBINED CPU+GPU BYTE BUDGET, AND AN HONEST ONE. A resident entry costs its
// GPU buffers PLUS the CPU copy the cache holds beside them, so both halves are
// COUNTED -- a budget that ignored the CPU half would under-report by exactly the
// amount that is easiest to forget.
//
// AND THE COROLLARY, which is what makes the count honest rather than merely
// generous (final-review I2, ruled): EVICTION ERASES THE WHOLE ENTRY, CPU COPY
// INCLUDED. A cache that freed only the GPU half would leave every evicted mesh's
// geometry in memory, uncounted and unshrinkable, while ResidentBytes() reported
// "fine" -- the one hazard s12 raises about residency, dressed as a policy.
// NriMeshBufferCache::ResidentBytes() is therefore EXACTLY the resident CPU+GPU
// bytes, with nothing hiding behind a not-ready entry.
//
// THE CPU COPY THAT SURVIVES AN EVICTION LIVES ONE LAYER UP, in the SUPPLY --
// SceneRenderResolver's in-memory MeshTable (SceneResources.hpp), already populated
// by the per-frame Request sweep. So s7.2's "re-upload after eviction without a
// disk read" still holds exactly: the first draw after an eviction costs one table
// lookup plus one upload, never an artifact read.
//
// 512 MiB, a compile-time constant for now. It becomes a cvar when the parked cvar
// arc lands, and that arc's own trigger discipline decides when -- this constant is
// NOT a placeholder to be "fixed" ahead of it.
//
// PER VEHICLE, NOT PER PROCESS (final-review I3). Every NriGraphContext creates its
// own NriMeshBufferCache (NriGraphContext.cpp's Create), so the editor's viewport
// vehicle, its thumbnail-harvester vehicle and one vehicle per open Mesh/Shader
// document EACH get the full budget below -- N x 512 MiB worst case, not 512 MiB
// shared. That mirrors NriTextureCache's own per-vehicle shape (which has no byte
// budget at all), so it is not a new divergence, but it IS the real shape the
// parked cvar arc inherits: a process-wide pool needs a shared allocator above
// these caches, not a smaller constant here.
//
// A DEDICATED MESH BUDGET HAS FIRST-CLASS UE PRECEDENT, and the earlier reading of
// Decision 7 understated it: alongside r.Streaming.PoolSize
// (StreamingManagerTexture.cpp:455-458) UE ships r.Streaming.PoolSizeForMeshes --
// default -1, meaning "share the texture pool", and any value >= 0 meaning a
// DEDICATED mesh pool of that size (TextureStreamingHelpers.cpp:125-129, consumed
// at AsyncTextureStreaming.cpp:668). So the shared pool is UE's DEFAULT, not UE's
// only shape, and a separate mesh budget is a configuration UE supports rather
// than a divergence we invented. Unification remains the eventual direction and
// the parked cvar arc is where it lands (comparison Decision 7).
