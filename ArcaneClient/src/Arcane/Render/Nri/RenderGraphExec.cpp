// RenderGraph, EXECUTION half. The declaration and
// compile halves live in RenderGraph.cpp and are PURE -- see RenderGraph.hpp's
// header for why the class is split across two TUs and why it must stay that
// way.
//
// What this TU owns: every GPU resource the graph holds (the transient pool,
// the cached attachment views, one command allocator + command buffer per
// frame slot, and the graph's own submission fence), the translation of
// RgCompiled into recorded NRI commands, and present sequencing.
//
// THE ONE CmdBarrier CALL SITE. Every barrier on the graph path is emitted by
// EmitBarriers() below, from an RgBarrier list Compile() derived. Nothing in
// this file synthesizes, reorders, drops or coalesces a barrier, and no other
// file on the graph path may call CmdBarrier at all (spec ratification 1;
// the one hand-written exemption in the tree is NriDiagnostics' fault
// dispatch, which states its own terms).
// The `before` triples Compile() hands over already account for pool-slot
// handover between transients, so replaying them verbatim is not laziness --
// re-deriving anything here would silently diverge from the derivation Task
// 4's tests pin.
//
// Include order: NRI headers first, ALWAYS (see NriCommon.hpp). NriDevice.hpp
// pulls in Extensions/NRIDeviceCreation.h, which declares nri::Message::ERROR;
// <windows.h> reaches this TU through Arcane/Base/Log.hpp -> spdlog and
// #defines ERROR via wingdi.h, corrupting every later textual "ERROR" in the
// TU if it lands first.

        //                                          GetCommandBufferNativeObject
        //
        // It is not a GpuPassScope subclass or a template over the two: the
        // classes share no member and no branch once the two calls differ.
        //
        // The crash backend comes from the process-wide slot
        // NriDiagnostics::Arm installs, and there is no other writer.
        // Every step degrades independently: no backend, an unarmed backend, a
        // backend that hands back no native command list, or a backend whose
        // marker buffer lives on ANOTHER DEVICE each disable exactly their own
        // channel and nothing else.
        //
        // THE CROSS-DEVICE RULE. Writing a native marker means recording,
        // into THIS command buffer, a write to the backend's marker buffer --
        // and both APIs require the two to share ONE device. A backend built
        // over a different device than the one recording produces, on Vulkan:
        //
        //   vkCmdWriteBufferMarkerAMD(): dstBuffer (VkBuffer ...) was created
        //   ... from VkDevice A, but command is using ... VkDevice B
        //   VUID-vkCmdWriteBufferMarkerAMD-commonparent
        //
        // and on dx12 the identical bug, mutely (WriteBufferImmediate against
        // a GPU virtual address minted by another device).
        //
        // So the marker is GATED ON DEVICE IDENTITY rather than assumed:
        // `nativeDevice` is this graph device's own native handle, and the
        // write happens only when the backend's marker buffer lives on that
        // same device. The gate cannot be forgotten and cannot be wrong in the
        // unsafe direction.
        //
        // WHAT IS NOT LOST if the gate ever closes: the CPU-side breadcrumb
        // ring (Breadcrumbs().BeginScope/EndScope) and the PIX/RenderDoc/DRED
        // annotation are both device-agnostic and both still emitted -- and the
        // ring is the half today's hang and crash reports are actually built
