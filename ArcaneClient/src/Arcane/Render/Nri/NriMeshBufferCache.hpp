// NriMeshBufferCache -- ONE Guid -> resident vertex/index buffer pair for the whole
// render path, and the retirement of the per-frame upload ring for mesh geometry.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS (research s3.4-1): MeshNode::Record uploaded every visible mesh's
// streams through the frame's TRANSIENT ring EVERY FRAME -- fine for unit
// primitives, ~3 MB per frame per mesh for a 100k-triangle import. R2's ruling is
// one cache owning CPU+GPU lifetime for ALL meshes, primitives included: the ring
// path for mesh geometry retires outright rather than being kept as a small-mesh
// fast path, because two upload paths is two lifetimes to reason about and the
// resident one is correct for both sizes.
//
// ARCHITECTURE MIRRORS NriTextureCache, deliberately and point for point: an
// injected supply (this class owns no file IO and no Assets knowledge -- a RENDER
// object must not grow a Runtime), failures memoized exactly once, a one-shot WARN
// latch, Release(graveyard, fence) as the sanctioned teardown with the destructor
// as a SAFETY NET that says so at WARN, and Invalidate(id, graveyard, fence) as the
// per-guid escape hatch. Read NriTextureCache.hpp's own banner first; every rule
// there applies here unless this comment says otherwise.
//
// WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM NriTextureCache, and why:
//   * A BYTE BUDGET AND AN LRU (MeshResidencyBudget.hpp). NriTextureCache has
//     neither -- it never evicts a single entry (NriGraphContext's own note says
//     so). Mesh geometry is where eviction became a real question (F2a's spec
//     assigned it here by name). EVICTION ERASES THE WHOLE ENTRY, the CPU copy
//     with it (final-review I2, ruled), so ResidentBytes() is exactly the
//     resident CPU+GPU bytes and a cold entry can never hide memory behind a
//     `ready == false`. The CPU copy that a re-upload reads after an eviction
//     is NOT kept here -- it lives in the SUPPLY (SceneRenderResolver's
//     in-memory MeshTable), so the next Resolve asks the supply again and that
//     ask is a table lookup, never an artifact read.
//   * NO COLOUR SPACE. A vertex buffer has no sRGB question, so the key is a bare
//     Guid rather than (Guid, space).
//   * NO PLACEHOLDER. A pending texture gets a checkerboard, which is a real,
//     visible, honest stand-in. There is no honest stand-in for a shape (s7.1:
//     "a placeholder cube would fabricate a shape"), so a pending mesh resolves to
//     NOTHING and the draw is skipped -- quietly while pending, loudly when
//     missing or refused.
//
// NO BARRIERS, and none needed -- uploads go through nri::HelperInterface::
// UploadData, which submits and waits internally, so these buffers are NOT graph
// resources. RESOLVE AT DECLARATION TIME ONLY, never inside a node's exec fn: the
// same rule, and the same reason, NriTextureCache states in full.

// Include order: NRI headers first, ALWAYS -- see NriCommon.hpp.
