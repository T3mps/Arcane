// NRI substrate (Phase 1, Task 7): the WRAPPER PATH.
//
// We create the D3D12/VK device ourselves -- keeping DRED configuration, the
// VK device-fault sweep, our own debug-message routing, and every capability
// the contract requires -- and hand the finished thing to NRI through
// `nriCreateDeviceFromVKDevice` / `nriCreateDeviceFromD3D12Device`. NRI then
// derives its capability model from the physical device plus the extension
// name lists in the desc, and does NOT take ownership of our native objects.
//
// A call to `nriCreateDevice` for a REAL backend (D3D12/VK) is a review
// defect (spec ratification 2) -- the only sanctioned use of that entry point
// in this tree is the NONE backend in the [nri] tests, which has no native
// device to wrap. Nothing in this header or its .cpp calls it.
//
// Include order: NRI's Extensions/NRIDeviceCreation.h declares nri::Message
// with an enumerator literally named ERROR, and <windows.h> (reachable
// through spdlog) #defines ERROR via wingdi.h. Keep the NRI includes first,
// here and in NriDevice.cpp -- same rule as NriCommon.hpp.
