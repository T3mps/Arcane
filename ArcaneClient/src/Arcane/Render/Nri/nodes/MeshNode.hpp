// MeshNode -- THE OPAQUE 3D PASS as a render graph node (NRI Phase 4, Task 7).
//
// This is the node that puts a lit, textured, DEPTH-TESTED mesh through the
// frame graph. It renders into the frame's canvas (the same RGBA16F transient
// the 2D batch draws into) with a D32_SFLOAT depth target it creates itself.
//
// WHAT IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT:
//   * NOT PBR. data/shaders/mesh.hlsl is one directional light, Lambert
//     diffuse plus a constant ambient term, one albedo texture. The GGX
//     material model belongs to the Deadlock-class renderer arc; a half
//     version here would be a second material model to reconcile.
//   * NOT a commitment to forward OR deferred. One opaque pass writing a
//     colour target and a depth target is the shared prefix of both.
//   * NOT a mesh IMPORT path. Geometry comes from MeshBuilder (procedural
//     cube/sphere); cgltf/.arcmesh is a later arc, and no library is vendored
//     for it here.
//   * NOT the material system. A per-instance linear tint (MeshInstance::
//     baseColor) plus, since Task 10, an optional per-instance MATERIAL SLOT
//     (MeshInstance::materialSlot) indexing this node's own BindlessTable is
//     the whole of it. A per-instance albedo Guid resolved into per-image
//     descriptor sets was written and then REMOVED at Task 7's first fix
//     round -- nothing exercised it, and Task 8/10's BindlessTable replaced
//     the fixed white-texel t0 binding it would have competed with outright.
//     Feeding the table from a REAL cooked albedo (rather than a test's own
//     generated textures) is Task 11's -- LANDED, in NriGraphContext::
//     ResolveMeshAlbedoSlot, not in this node -- this node still only ever
//     sees an already-resolved nri::Descriptor* through AddMaterial.
//
// WHERE IT SITS IN THE FRAME: after `batch2d`, before the post chain and the
// tonemap. The canvas is MINTED AND CLEARED by AddBatch2DNode, so the mesh
// pass is necessarily the canvas's second writer -- it clears the DEPTH plane
// (which is a fresh pool slot with undefined contents) and never the colour
// one, or it would wipe the 2D content that ran before it. Rendering 3D UNDER
// the 2D layer instead is a clear-seam question (NriGraphContext::
// DeclareGraphFrame's THE CLEAR SEAM block), not this node's.
//
// WHAT THIS NODE OWNS (all persistent, all created once at Create()):
//   * the BINDLESS MATERIAL TABLE (Task 8/10) -- a BindlessTable of
//     kBindlessCapacity SRV slots, gated on NriDeviceCaps::SupportsBindless()
//     at Create() (tier 0 refuses the node outright rather than render wrong
//     pixels) -- and the ONE
//     descriptor set its array lives in. This REPLACED the node's own 1x1
//     white texel + t0 binding outright: `kInvalidSlot` (MeshInstance::
//     materialSlot's default) now selects a FLAT path in mesh.hlsl that
//     skips sampling entirely, bit-for-bit F2a's old white-times-tint
//     arithmetic;
//   * the pipeline layout -- root constants b0 (the 8-byte MeshRootConstants
//     {firstOutput, flags}, F3 plan 1 T7 -- the 128-byte per-instance
//     MeshConstants block of Task 8/F2a is GONE; every per-instance value is
//     a field of the GPU scene's row now) at the implicit rootRegisterSpace,
//     ONE immutable ROOT SAMPLER at s0 (Task 10's slice-one trilinear
//     sampler -- also rootRegisterSpace; THE REGISTER-SPACE RULE below is
//     why that space can no longer be shared with either descriptor set),
//     plus TWO ordinary descriptor sets: space1 = { b1 frame CB, t0 the
//     instance rows, t1 this slot's visible indices }, space2 = { t0
//     bindless material array };
//   * one descriptor pool, and ONE descriptor set PER FRAME SLOT for space1
//     (CreateSets). Its b1 range is written ONCE, at Create, and never
//     rewritten; its t0/t1 ranges (F3) are REWRITTEN per slot, in Record,
//     whenever the GPU scene's buffers changed under it -- the instance
//     buffer grew (GpuScene::InstanceBufferGeneration) or the slot's
//     visible-index buffer was re-created (GpuScene::VisibleIndicesView).
//     That rewrite is safe for the same reason the arena write is: the
//     slot's PREVIOUS frame retired at BeginFrame (the swapchain's fence
//     wait), so nothing in flight reads that slot's set. Batch2DNode's sets
//     are never rewritten at all; this one is rewritten only for the
//     CURRENT slot, only when a buffer moved, under ALLOW_UPDATE_AFTER_SET.
//     The bindless set is DIFFERENT again: allocated ONCE (not per frame
//     slot, since its contents do not vary by frame) and written
//     INCREMENTALLY by AddMaterial as slots are Added -- see that method's
//     own comment for the synchronization contract that discipline costs;
//   * the per-frame-slot constant-buffer arena the b1 views name.
// The GPU SCENE's buffers are NOT owned here: GpuScene (Render/Nri/
// GpuScene.hpp, owned by NriGraphContext) holds the instance / args /
// visible-index buffers, GpuSceneSyncNode writes them ahead of this pass,
// and Record receives the GpuScene* as a parameter.
// The PIPELINE is not owned here: it comes from the vehicle's shared
// NriPipelineCache, keyed by (shader pair, layout, canvas format, DEPTH
// format, blend), so a format change is a cache miss rather than a stale PSO.
//
// THE REGISTER-SPACE RULE (Batch2DNode.hpp states it in full, verified
// against Source/Validation/DeviceVal.hpp's `rootDescriptorNum ||
// rootSamplerNum` guard): NRI refuses a pipeline layout whose
// rootRegisterSpace equals any descriptor set's registerSpace, but ONLY
// once the layout carries a root DESCRIPTOR or root SAMPLER -- root
// CONSTANTS alone are exempt (VK lowers them to push constants, outside the
// set-space numbering entirely). Batch2DNode has neither and keeps
// everything at space0; THIS layout is the first in the tree to add a root
// SAMPLER (Task 10's immutable s0), so its root space and its two ordinary
// sets must all be distinct register spaces -- see MeshNode.cpp's
// CreateBindings() for the concrete numbers and mesh.hlsl for the matching
// `register(..., spaceN)` annotations, including the SPIR-V register-shift
// entries (compile-shaders.bat / ShaderConventions.hpp::kSpirvArgs) that
// have to agree with them.
//
// WHY THE SETS ARE PER FRAME SLOT and Batch2DNode's built-in ones are not: a
// set here carries the per-frame constant buffer b1, whose (buffer, offset) is
// baked into its nri::Descriptor at creation. Double-buffering the CB means
// double-buffering the set that names it. See Batch2DNode.hpp's THE
// CONSTANT-BUFFER ARENA for the whole account of why the upload ring cannot
// back a constant buffer that a descriptor set names.
//
// WINDING AND CULLING -- read MeshBuilder.hpp's WINDING block first. That
// module emits triangles that are COUNTER-CLOCKWISE as seen from OUTSIDE the
// surface, and this node's rasterizer state is set to match:
// `frontCounterClockwise = true` + `cullMode = BACK`. See MeshNode.cpp's
// PipelineFor() for the full derivation (and the desk check that falsifies it
// in one look: get it backwards and a closed mesh renders INSIDE-OUT or, for a
// convex one, vanishes entirely).
//
// Include order: NRI headers first, ALWAYS -- see NriCommon.hpp
