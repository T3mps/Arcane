// RenderGraph -- Phase 2's declarative frame graph, declaration side (Task
// 3). Design informed by Filament's frame graph (filament/src/fg,
// Apache-2.0): the eager-setup/deferred-execute split and resource handles
// over raw pointers come from FrameGraph.h/PassNode/ResourceNode; this
// version is deliberately smaller (no subresources, no culling, no real
// aliasing yet -- see the plan's Deadlock chassis criteria).
//
// Scope (plan: docs/plans/2026-08-13-nri-phase2-framegraph-2d-cutover.md,
// Tasks 3+4+6): declaration (Task 3), compile (Task 4) and execution
// (Task 6). The class is split across TWO translation units on purpose:
//
//   RenderGraph.cpp      declaration + Compile() -- PURE, no nri device
//                        calls at all (desc/enum types only: nri::Format,
//                        nri::AccessLayoutStage, nri::AccessBits,
//                        nri::Layout, nri::StageBits, nri::BufferUsageBits
//                        are pure data, never dereferenced as devices/
//                        queues/etc. there). Compiling the same
//                        declarations twice yields the same RgCompiled, so
//                        the executor consumes it VERBATIM.
//   RenderGraphExec.cpp  Execute() and everything that owns GPU state --
//                        the transient pool, cached attachment views, the
//                        per-frame-slot command buffers, the submission
//                        fence, and RenderGraphNodeContext::Resolve/
//                        ColorView. This is the ONLY TU on the graph path
//                        that calls nri::CoreInterface::CmdBarrier.
//
// Keep that split: a device call creeping into Compile()'s TU would make
// the derivation impure and untestable headless, which is what every Task-4
// test depends on.
//
// Execution order = declaration order. Phase 2 does not reorder, cull, or
// parallelize nodes: AddNode() appends to a flat vector and Task 6's
// executor walks it front to back. Revisit only if a later phase's
// profiling data demands it.
//
// Include order: NRI's Extensions/NRIDeviceCreation.h (deliberately NOT
// included by this TU) is what causes the nri::Message::ERROR / wingdi.h
// ERROR macro clash documented in NriCommon.hpp. This file only needs
// NRIDescs.h-level plain data (Format, AccessLayoutStage, BufferUsageBits,
// the opaque Texture/Buffer/CommandBuffer/Descriptor handles, CoreInterface)
// -- <NRI.h> alone provides all of it. Keep it that way; do not add an
// Extensions include here without re-reading that comment.

    // WHAT TASK 6'S EXECUTOR REPLAYS, AND WHAT IT MUST MERGE: nothing needs

    // IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING tenant's outgoing state in its `before` (not
    // necessarily the very first tenant's -- a 3+-tenant chain hands over
    // link by link). ALL THREE FIELDS carry, LAYOUT INCLUDED, so the handover
    // is an ordinary state-to-state transition that performs the source
    // availability operation the reused physical resource needs.
    //
    // `before.layout` used to be forced to UNDEFINED (a contents-discarding
    // transition). That was the D2 dx12 blocker: NRI's D3D12 backend pairs it
    // with the carried non-NONE access and D3D12_TEXTURE_BARRIER_FLAG_DISCARD
    // (ThirdParty/NRI/Source/D3D12/CommandBufferD3D12.hpp:1054-1056,
    // :1078-1079), an illegal enhanced-barrier combination that invalidates
    // the command list and fails Close(). See RenderGraph.cpp's POOL HANDOVER
    // comment for the full argument and the rejected alternatives.
    //
    // A HANDOVER ALWAYS PRODUCES A BARRIER, including when the two tenants
    // want the same state -- the consecutive-same-state elision does not
    // apply to a change of tenant. (While the layout was forced to UNDEFINED
    // that held by accident, since nothing ever WANTS UNDEFINED.)
    //
    // The executor's whole job is translation: emit each node's preBarriers
    // as ONE nri CmdBarrier group immediately before that node, run the
    // node, then emit exitBarriers after the last one -- textures via
    // nri::TextureBarrierDesc (full AccessLayoutStage triples) and buffers
    // via nri::BufferBarrierDesc (access + stages only; drop the layout,
    // which is always UNDEFINED for a buffer). It must not synthesize,
    // reorder, drop, or coalesce barriers, and must not derive any state of
    // its own: doing so silently diverges from the derivation this task's
    // tests pin.
    //
    // ONE amendment, and only one, is the executor's to make (Task 6 fix
    // round 1): the CROSS-FRAME half of the pool handover. The transient pool
    // survives Reset(), so two consecutive frames share one physical
    // resource -- and Compile() is pure and per-frame, so the `before` it
    // derives for a slot's first use is always {NONE, UNDEFINED, ALL}
    // regardless of what the previous frame left there. The executor patches
    // exactly that first barrier per pool slot per frame, replacing `before`
    // with the whole state IT observed the resource being left in (access,
    // layout and stages) -- the identical operation the POOL HANDOVER block in
    // RenderGraph.cpp performs for a within-frame tenant change, applied where
    // Compile() cannot see. It is not a derivation of its own: it is an
    // observation Compile() has no access to. It also never ADDS or REMOVES a
    // barrier -- the one it patches is already in Compile()'s list. See
    // RenderGraph::PoolResource::carry.

    // different index spaces live in this block and they are NOT the same:
