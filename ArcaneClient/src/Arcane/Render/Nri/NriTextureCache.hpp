// NriTextureCache -- ONE Guid -> nri::Texture residency cache for the whole
// render path.
//
// IT IS SHARED BY EVERY NODE THAT SAMPLES AN ASSET, and that sharing is the
// point: a sprite's own texture (t0, from Batch2DDrawSpan::textureId), a
// registered material's DECLARED params (t1..), and a post material's
// declared params all resolve through THIS cache -- so an image named by a
// sprite and by a post pass gets ONE upload rather than two.
//
// WHERE THE PIXELS COME FROM, and why this class does not decode. The bytes
// arrive through an injected `PixelSupplyFn` -- in production
// `Assets::PixelsFor(Guid)`, the engine's retained decode-once pixel cache,
// which is DEVICE-FREE by charter. So this class owns no file I/O, no stb call
// and no knowledge of the project registry. It is the same injection shape
// (and the same reasoning) as NriGraphContext::AssetResolveFn: a RENDER object
// must not grow a Runtime.
//
// THE SRGB RULE: scene content uploads RGBA8_SRGB, because the canvas is
// LINEAR and the hardware does the decode -- a UNORM view would render the
// same asset visibly brighter. See ColorSpace below for the other half.
//
// FAILURES ARE MEMOIZED, exactly once each: an entry is inserted BEFORE the
// first early return, with null members, so an unresolvable or undecodable
// image is attempted once rather than re-attempted every frame by a sprite
// that is still on screen. The ONE-SHOT "not resident" WARN lives here too and
// fires only on a Resolve that MISSES -- a frame full of colored quads (every
// span carrying a nil Guid) says nothing at all.
//
// NO BARRIERS, and none needed. Uploads go through NRI's own
// HelperInterface::UploadData, which submits and waits internally and leaves
// the texture in SHADER_RESOURCE -- so these textures are NOT graph resources
// (they are persistent, never written by a node, and their state never
// changes), which is why nothing about them appears in a compiled frame. They
// must therefore be resolved at DECLARATION time, never from inside a node's
// exec fn: UploadData submitting while the frame's command buffer is open is
// exactly the shape the graph's no-hand-barriers rule exists to prevent.
//
// Include order: NRI headers first, ALWAYS -- see NriCommon.hpp
// (Extensions/NRIDeviceCreation.h declares nri::Message::ERROR and
// <windows.h>, via spdlog, #defines ERROR through wingdi.h).

        //              to linear for the linear canvas and the hardware does
        //              the work. THE DEFAULT, and what every existing caller
        //              (Batch2DNode's sprites, PostChainNode's declared
        //              params) gets without asking.
        //   Display -- ImGui. Uploads RGBA8_UNORM, so the sampled texel goes
        //              STRAIGHT to a display-referred target. ImGuiNri draws
        //              after the tonemap and its own font atlas is UNORM for

        //              time and the image renders visibly dark.
        //
