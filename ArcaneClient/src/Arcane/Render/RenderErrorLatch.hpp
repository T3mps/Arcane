// THE RENDER-LAYER ERROR LATCH -- the 0/0 gate's one counter, and the one
// device-removed hook slot.

// It is the instrument every host, every GPU test and every desk battery
// reads (`RenderErrorCount B -> N`), and every render-side producer --
// ARC_NRI_CHECK, the executor, the nodes, the pipeline cache, the ImGui
// layer -- bumps it.
//
// A header-only function-local-static singleton, driven only from inside
// ArcaneClient.dll, with two atomics and the public seams below -- which is
// why the exported *ForTest shims exist.
