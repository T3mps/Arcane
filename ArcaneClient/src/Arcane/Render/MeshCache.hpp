// MeshCache: resolves .arcmesh Guids referenced by MeshRenderer::mesh into
// Arcane::MeshEntry records for the scene's MeshTable. Mirrors SpriteCache's
// host integration (SpriteCache.hpp) and its structure almost exactly -- like
// that cache, there is no async compile step of its OWN here: load the
// .arcmesh JSON (LoadMeshAsset), then resolve its geometry through
// Mesh/MeshAsset.hpp's ResolveMeshData (F2c Task 11) -- a generated source
// resolves synchronously in that one call (BuildMeshData + ComputeMeshBounds
// internally, unchanged since before Task 11), but an Imported source can
// come back PendingCook: the mesh COOK is async (arccook, or the editor's
// background queue), even though this cache's OWN resolve step is not. See
// Request's own comment for what PendingCook does to the per-frame contract
// below.
//
// FAILURE DISCIPLINE, and this is the one place this cache DIFFERS from
// SpriteCache rather than mirroring it: a failed resolve (unresolvable Guid,
// missing file, malformed JSON, an invalid mesh) stays OUT of the published
// table, in a separate `failed` set -- SpriteMaterialCache's scheme
// (SpriteMaterialCache.cpp:49,97-101), not SpriteCache's own "cache a visible
// placeholder" one. A sprite has a natural placeholder (a 1x1 m untextured
// quad); a mesh does not -- there is no meaningful "wrong shape" to draw
// instead of the right one, and drawing one would be worse than drawing
// nothing. So a nullptr Resolve() is the correct outcome, and
// MeshSubmissionSystem (Task 5) is expected to skip the entity entirely, the
// same way it would for a nil MeshRenderer::mesh.
//
// PendingCook (F2c Task 11) is a THIRD outcome, neither success nor failure:
// an Imported mesh whose cook has not landed YET stays out of BOTH `table`
// and `failed` -- see Request's own comment for why entering `failed` here
// would be the exact regression F2b's desk-fix 2 fixed for the texture path.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT KEEP: the loaded MeshAssetData. An `AssetFor(Guid) ->
// const MeshAssetData*` accessor lived here through Tasks 4-11, backed by a
// second map beside `table`, on the stated premise that Task 5's material
// chain would read the mesh's own default `material` Guid through it. Task 5
// resolved that differently and better -- MeshEntry::slots (F2c Task 10 grew
// this from a scalar `material`; SceneResources.hpp) carries the Guid(s) on
// the published table, so the submission sweep needs no cache pointer at all
// -- and no other consumer ever appeared: MeshDocument, its one named
// candidate, edits the SOURCE .arcmesh and never touches the resolved cache.
// Deleted at F2a close with zero production callers, which also removes the
// second map and the write-ordering hazard between the two.
//
// ENGINE-SIDE, not editor-side, from the moment it is written -- the same
// placement rule the sprite-resolution lift (2026-07-29) established for
// SpriteCache: this lives in Arcane.dll so both the editor and the
// standalone runtime host draw through the one implementation.
