// Arcane::ArtifactReader -- the ArcaneClient-local reader for ".arcart" artifacts. As of
// F2c Task 4 this covers BOTH artifact kinds the container format carries: Texture
// (ReadClientArtifact, F2b Task 6) and Mesh (ReadClientMeshArtifact, F2c Task 4).
//
// BYTE-CONTRACT PEER: ArcaneAssetPipeline/src/Arcane/AssetPipeline/ArtifactFormat.hpp/.cpp
// (Task 1's texture writer, Task 3's mesh writer) is the OTHER half of this contract. This
// file is a DELIBERATE, INDEPENDENT reimplementation -- ArcaneClient must never link or
// #include ArcaneAssetPipeline (premake keeps that structurally true: ArcaneClient's
// includedirs carry no AssetPipeline path), so the two sides stay byte-compatible ONLY by
// both following the SAME written format, never by sharing code. A change to the on-disk
// layout in ArtifactFormat.cpp must be mirrored here BY HAND, or the cross-lib round-trip
// tests (ArtifactReaderTest.cpp for Texture, MeshArtifactReaderTest.cpp for Mesh -- each
// writes fixtures through the pipeline's own writer and reads them back through THIS
// reader) fail loudly. Add/keep this same paragraph, naming this file, in
// ArtifactFormat.hpp's own header comment.

// ON-DISK FORMAT (mirrors ArtifactFormat.hpp's header comment field-for-field; every

// dependent):

//                        per mip, in order (slice-major, mip-minor when arrayOrDepth > 1)
//     Payload   (tag 2): raw texel bytes for every mip, back to back, addressed by each
//                        mip's own offset/size into this section
//     Thumbnail (tag 3): raw, uncompressed RGBA8 bytes, thumbWidth x thumbHeight
//
//   MESH TAIL (contentKind == 2 only; ReadClientMeshArtifact's own shape, F2c Task 4,

//     aabbMin           f32 x3

//                            back to back, NOT a struct memcpy -- field by field, exactly
//                            like every other multi-byte field in this format
//     IndexData    (tag 5): indexCount u32 indices, back to back
//     SectionTable (tag 6): sectionCount u32, then per section: nameLen u16, name bytes
//                            (nameLen of them, NOT null-terminated), indexOffset u32,
//                            indexCount u32, slotIndex u32 -- this is the MESH's own
//                            per-drawable-range table, NOT the shared container section
//                            table just above it (that one is a fixed {tag,offset,size}
//                            index with no tag of its own)
//     Tangents     (tag 7): RESERVED, UNWRITTEN in v1 -- a future arc appends it
//                            additively under the skip-unknown rule below
//     Thumbnail    (tag 3): RESERVED for mesh too, UNWRITTEN in v1 (R5 harvests it
//                            editor-side later) -- shares Texture's own tag 3, which is
//                            exactly why the skip-unknown rule matters: a mesh reader
//                            must tolerate a texture-kind tag turning up unused, and vice
//                            versa, since both kinds share ONE tag space
//     SECTION-RANGE VALIDATION: for every decoded SectionTable entry, indexOffset +
//     indexCount must not exceed the header's own indexCount -- a section pointing past
//     the index buffer is refused (Missing), never clamped or silently accepted, since
//     letting it through would hand the draw path an out-of-range index range (the
//     pipeline's ReadMeshArtifact applies the identical check for the identical reason).
//     SECTIONCOUNT AGREEMENT: the header's declared sectionCount must equal the number of
//     SectionTable entries actually decoded (zero, if the SectionTable section itself was
//     absent) -- a mismatch is refused (Missing), the same "declared must match decoded"
//     discipline the count-agreement rule below applies to vertices/indices.
//     The header's declared vertexCount/indexCount must agree with what was actually
//     DECODED: a file declaring nonzero counts but omitting the VertexData and/or
//     IndexData section entirely is refused (Missing) rather than accepted with nonzero
//     declared counts paired with empty arrays -- an absent body disagrees with its
//     declared count maximally, the same class of corruption a truncated section is (the
//     pipeline's ReadMeshArtifact refuses with nullopt for the identical reason; the two
//     readers agree on this rule through this paragraph, not through shared code).
//
//   CONTAINER SECTION TABLE (shared structure, both kinds, no tag of its own):
//     sectionCount      u32
//     sectionCount * { tag u32, offset u64, size u64 }
//   A section tag this reader does not recognise -- including a tag that belongs to the
//   OTHER content kind -- is SKIPPED, not an error -- the same forward-compat rule
//   ArtifactFormat.hpp's reader states (a future artifact kind, or a reserved tag not yet
//   written, can add/occupy a section without breaking either reader).
//
// GUID -> ARTIFACT RESOLUTION (this task's own judgment call): there is no index FILE on
// disk to read -- ArtifactStore's Guid -> cook-key index (ArtifactStore.hpp) is IN-MEMORY
// ONLY, rebuilt by scanning Artifacts/**/*.arcart; nothing in ArcaneAssetPipeline or
// arccook ever persists it. FindArtifactForGuid below therefore does its OWN directory
// scan of <intermediateDir>/Artifacts/**/*.arcart, reading only a BOUNDED PREFIX of each
// candidate (ArtifactReader.cpp's ReadFilePrefix/kHeaderProbeBytes -- 256 bytes, generous
// headroom over the fixed header's own exact 64) to test the sourceGuid match -- a few
// hundred bytes per candidate file, never the whole artifact (payload/thumbnail
// included), even across a project's whole artifact set, and it needs no persistent state
// of its own. CORRECTNESS NOTE: this paragraph used to claim exactly this cost while the
// code underneath (ReadHeaderOnly -> ReadWholeFile) actually read every candidate's ENTIRE
// file every scan -- caught by review, fixed the same task the claim was made in
// (ArtifactReader.cpp's ReadHeaderOnly/ReadFilePrefix carry the fix's own comment); take
// this kind of claim as something to VERIFY against the code, not trust from a comment.
//
// F2c TASK 4 FIX -- THE KIND-AGNOSTIC SCAN: FindArtifactForGuid's per-candidate probe (then
// named ReadHeaderOnly) used to parse the TEXTURE-shaped fixed header (ParseHeader, which
// fails closed on any contentKind != Texture) -- correct for a texture READ, but it made
// FindArtifactForGuid blind to every mesh artifact: a mesh could be cooked, committed to
// disk, and still resolve as Missing forever, no matter how many times it was recooked,
// because the scan itself never got past the contentKind gate to even compare the guid. That
// probe (renamed ReadCommonPrefixOnly) now parses ONLY the kind-agnostic COMMON PREFIX
// (ParseCommonPrefix in ArtifactReader.cpp -- 37 bytes: magic 4 + artifactVersion 4 +
// contentKind 1 + sourceGuid 16 + sourceHash 8 + importerVersion 4 -- comfortably inside the
// same kHeaderProbeBytes-bounded read above, so the cost claim in the paragraph above is
// still true), so the scan recognises every content kind's sourceGuid. Each per-kind FULL
// reader (ReadClientArtifact, ReadClientMeshArtifact) keeps its OWN fail-closed contentKind
// check unchanged -- the scan just no longer gates on it.
//
// C1(b) FIX (final-review wave, 2026-09-04): FindArtifactForGuid returns EVERY
// guid-matching candidate, not just the first the scan happens to visit. The single-match
// version was a real bug: a recook under a NEW cook key can leave the SUPERSEDED old-key
// artifact still on disk for one pass (CookSession's own self-heal, C1a, removes it
// best-effort, but a locked file or an external tool can still leave one behind), and
// BOTH the stale and the fresh artifact carry the SAME sourceGuid header -- so a
// first-match resolve could pick the stale one in unspecified directory-iteration order
// and refuse HashMismatch forever even though a valid artifact sits right next to it. The
// caller (Assets.cpp's ResolveArtifact) is the one that actually VALIDATES each candidate
// via ReadClientArtifact -- this function stays a cheap, header-only, format-agnostic
// scan; it does not itself decide which candidate wins. See Assets.cpp for how the result
// is memoized per-Guid at the facade layer (the SAME decode-once-then-cache shape
// PixelsFor already uses), which is what keeps a repeat lookup for the same guid from
// re-scanning (Missing included -- Task 8 memoized it alongside the other refusals;
// Task 12's cook-completion invalidation is the un-latch).
//
// REFUSAL DISCIPLINE (spec s5, F2b Task 6 ruling; Task 8 completed it -- "refuse, never limp"):
// applies IDENTICALLY to ReadClientMeshArtifact (F2c Task 4) -- SAME three states, SAME
// subsumption clause, just checked against kClientMeshImporterVersionMirror instead of
// kClientTextureImporterVersionMirror.
//   Missing                 -- no artifact at all resolves for this guid. A REAL refusal
//                               at the Assets facade layer since Task 8 (the sprite
//                               cutover): content is artifact-only, the stb fallback is
//                               retired, and a missing artifact refuses by name
//                               ("ArtifactMissing"), memoized and latched like the other
//                               two states below. For the mesh reader this is also the
//                               catch-all for "cannot be used and is not one of the two
//                               named refusals": absent file, unparseable/corrupt bytes,
//                               wrong contentKind, or a header sourceGuid that does not
//                               match the caller's expectedSourceGuid.
//   HashMismatch             -- an artifact EXISTS for this guid, but its header sourceHash
//                               disagrees with the hash of the CURRENT staged source bytes:
//                               the cook is stale (a source was edited without recooking)
//                               or broken. Refuses loudly -- serving stale pixels over a
//                               known-bad artifact would mask exactly the failure the cook
//                               step exists to catch.
//   VersionNewerThanEngine   -- the artifact's importerVersion is NEWER than this build's
//                               own kClientTextureImporterVersionMirror (or, for a mesh
//                               artifact, kClientMeshImporterVersionMirror): THIS ENGINE is
//                               the stale side (a downgrade, or a build-skew cook farm).
//                               Refuses loudly for the same reason.
//   SUBSUMPTION CLAUSE (restated from the spec): an artifact OLDER than the engine
//   (importerVersion < the mirror) is NOT a third refusal kind -- it collapses into Missing.
//   CookSession's own staleness check folds importerVersion into the cook KEY
//   (ComputeCookKey), so an artifact cooked under an older importer version already sits at
//   a DIFFERENT key than what today's importer would produce; the CURRENT key simply has no
//   artifact there, which the ordinary Missing path already covers without a distinct case.
//   Only a NEWER importerVersion is genuinely a different situation (this engine cannot
//   even interpret the format that artifact might be using), which is why it alone earns a
//   named refusal.
