// PrepareSceneForRender -- the host's three calls per frame (F3, spec s4/s5):
// build the visible set(s), sync the GPU-scene mirror, build the frame. Called
// AFTER the fixed/update schedulers (WorldTransform + WorldBounds current) and
// BEFORE RunLoop::SubmitRender (the sprite sweep reads views[0]). Header-only
// so the two frame drivers (EditorAppFrame.cpp, RuntimeFrame.cpp) share one
// definition and ArcaneTests can drive it without a device.
//
// TWO VIEWS when they differ: in Play the sprites draw with View() (the scene
// camera's orthographic view) while the mesh pass draws with the perspective
// scene camera (RuntimeFrame.cpp's ActivePerspectiveSceneCamera). Each pass
// culls against its own camera: views[0] = main, views[1] = mesh. F5 unifies
// the two passes under one view; until then the second set is the honest one.
//
// NRI-FREE, deliberately: the one device fact this needs -- the mirror
// generation the GpuScene last acknowledged -- comes through the exported
// free function below (defined in Render/Nri/GpuScene.cpp, which is where
// <NRI.h> is visible), so this header pulls neither GpuScene.hpp nor NRI and
// ArcaneTests' ~[gpu] cases include it as freely as GpuSceneSync.hpp.

    // contract). False for a null device, and IDEMPOTENT: a host that arms the
    // same scene twice (the editor rebuilds its viewport context) keeps
    // whatever has already landed.

    // WHO ARMS, and why the two hosts differ: the RUNTIME arms at boot on
    // EVERY run, because its HUD prints the count every frame whether or not a
    // report was asked for (RuntimeFrame.cpp's BuildHud, and spec s9.5's desk
    // pass reads exactly that line). The EDITOR arms only on a --report run:
    // it has no such line, so outside a report nothing would read the answer.
    // Every other consumer -- MeshDocument's preview, the thumbnail harvester,
    // the [gpu] cases that never ask -- leaves it unarmed, declares no copy
    // node, and pays nothing.

    // GpuSceneVisibleRows answers the most recently COMPLETED readback's
    // GPU-visible row count -- every emitted batch's instanceNum, summed -- or
    // nullopt when the ring is unarmed or no result has landed yet. NULLOPT IS
