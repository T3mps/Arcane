    // the body.

    // An id with no host override left empty is NOT tolerated silently: Make()
    // substitutes a sentinel body that logs ARC_ERROR naming the exact id and
    // returns false, so a Fatal stage hard-aborts boot instead of the host
    // quietly skipping the step and reporting success -- the sentinel exists
    // BECAUSE "a host forgot a step and nothing said so" is the literal shape
    // of all three shipped bugs above, and BootStageParityTest's id-only

    // patched it. A host for which a given id is LEGITIMATELY a no-op (e.g.
    // ArcaneRuntime's edit_core, which has no scene-session/undo-history
    // analog) must patch it to an explicit `[]{ return true; }` with a
    // comment saying so -- relying on the sentinel to happen to look like
    // success is exactly what this paragraph exists to forbid.
    //
    // Adding an engine-wide install/publish step? Add the id HERE (with a
    // shared body if one is possible) and both hosts' lists gain it;
