// SceneRenderResolver: the per-frame bridge between what a scene REFERENCES
// (asset Guids on components) and what the submission path can DRAW (resolved
// tables + a bound post chain). One call per frame, from every host.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. RenderSubmissionSystem (Scene/RenderSystems.hpp) never
// touches the Assets facade by design: it reads two pre-resolved lookup tables
// the host must publish every frame (SceneResources.hpp:4 states the contract).
// Until 2026-07-29 only the Arcane Editor did -- the resolution cache itself
// lived in ArcaneEditor/src/SpriteCache.hpp -- so the standalone runtime host
// structurally could not draw a textured sprite whatever the scene contained,
// and neither could it bind a sprite material or a post chain. That is the
// second capability in one evening that the editor grew and the standalone host
// never got (the first was the camera, now Scene/SceneCamera.hpp). The fix
// under the homogenized-rendering directive is not a second cache in the
// runtime: it is ONE engine-side implementation both hosts drive.
// Brief: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-29-sprite-resolution-lift.md
// Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-sprite-resolution-lift-design.md
//
// WHAT IT OWNS. Five caches that turn a Guid into something bindable --
// SpriteCache (.arcsprite -> texture/UVs/size/pivot), SpriteMaterialCache
// (.arcmat -> a registered Batcher2D material id) and PostChainCache (.arcmat ->
// a bound post chain, published as PostChainDesc bytes for the graph
// recorder). Those three share one compile drain site, which is why they
// belong to one owner: splitting them would mean a second Drain(), and
// ShaderCompiler::Drain is the ONE place a compile result is taken up
// (ShaderCompiler.hpp:9-13).
//
// F2a (Task 6) adds their 3D siblings, MeshCache (.arcmesh -> owned CPU
// geometry + local bounds, Render/MeshCache.hpp) and MeshMaterialCache
// ("mesh"-kind .arcmat -> constants-only ResolvedMeshMaterial,
// Render/MeshMaterialCache.hpp). NEITHER touches ShaderCompiler at all -- a
// "mesh"-kind .arcmat carries no snippet to compile in the first place
// (MeshMaterialCache.hpp:9-21) -- so they do not extend the drain-sharing
// argument above; they still join this class rather than standing alone,
// for the OTHER reason every cache here is together (see WHY THIS EXISTS):
// one per-frame call, and one project-backed `resolveAsset` closure (built
// once in the constructor) that every cache -- compiling or not -- resolves
// its Guids through. A second owner for the two mesh caches would mean a
// second copy of that closure, which is exactly the kind of drift the
// sprite arc's lift was fixing in the first place.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN. The camera (a pure sweep -- Scene/SceneCamera.hpp),
// the batcher, and the compile service: all injected. It never renders, and
// it holds no graphics device at all.
