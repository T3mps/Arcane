# The 3D foundations assessment

**Date:** 2026-08-21
**Status:** assessment — input to a spec, not itself a plan
**Trigger:** NRI Phase 4 (the 3D slice) reached Task 9 and could not proceed
**Decision it records:** one 3D `Transform`, foundations before visuals, no cobbling

---

## Why this document exists

NRI Phase 4 set out to put a lit, textured, depth-tested mesh through the frame
graph. Tasks 1–8 do that, and they hold up. Task 9 — *"both hosts populate the
mesh scene from the scene"* — turned out not to be implementable, and the reason
is structural rather than an oversight in the plan's wording.

**The scene has no 3D in it.**

The complete component set in `ArcaneClient/src/Arcane/Scene/Components.hpp` is
`Transform`, `WorldTransform`, `PreviousTransform`, `SpriteRenderer`,
`PostProcess`, `Camera`, `Identity`, `Hidden`. There is no mesh component, and
`Transform` is two-dimensional:

```cpp
struct Transform {                       // Components.hpp:21
    glm::vec2 position;
    float     rotation;                  // one angle
    glm::vec2 scale;
    glm::mat3 ToMatrix() const;          // mat3, not mat4
};
struct WorldTransform { glm::mat3 matrix; };            // :40
struct PreviousTransform { glm::vec2 position; float rotation; };  // :52
```

`MeshNode` therefore receives geometry through a side channel —
`MeshSceneDesc::instances`, a borrowed `std::span<const MeshInstance>` whose
elements each carry a `glm::mat4 model` computed by the **caller**. Nothing in
the ECS produces those. A host asked to "populate it from the scene" has nothing
to read.

The same root cause explains a gap found earlier in the phase and filed then as
a Task 5 limitation: the perspective camera has projection but **no pose**. It
always looks down `−Z` from a 2D-position-derived eye. That is not an omission in
Task 5 — it is a consequence of nothing in the scene having a 3D pose to give it.

It also puts the engine in the position its own source argues against.
`Components.hpp:109-111` justifies making the camera scene data:

> *"That made the editor viewport and a standalone runtime get their view from
> different places, so a scene could look correct in the editor and render
> nothing in the game. A camera IS scene data."*

Meshes currently have exactly that split.

---

## What is already right — do not rebuild it

**The transform hierarchy exists and is dimension-agnostic in structure.**
This is the single most important finding here, because it is the expensive half
of a transform system and it is done.

`Scene/TransformSystems.hpp` walks `reg.GetRelations(root).ForEachDescendant` in
**BFS pre-order, parent before child**, handles the root/no-parent case
separately, adds a missing `WorldTransform` on demand, skips non-spatial nodes,
and composes:

```cpp
const Astra::Entity   parent      = reg.GetParent(e);
const WorldTransform* parentWorld = reg.GetComponent<WorldTransform>(parent);
const glm::mat3       parentMat   = parentWorld ? parentWorld->matrix : glm::mat3(1.0f);
world->matrix = parentMat * local->ToMatrix();
```

Astra supplies `GetParent` / `GetRelations` / `ForEachDescendant`. Ordering,
parenting, and the root case are all solved and none of them are 2D-specific.
**Going 3D is a type change through existing machinery, not a new subsystem.**

Also already correct and not in question:

- **Camera is scene data** (`Camera` component, `SceneCamera` resolves it).
- **Units are MKS/meters**, consistently, with the reasoning recorded in-source.
- **The render layer**: NRI graph, pipeline cache (graphics + compute), device
  capability gating, `mipCount`, the depth transient, `MeshNode`, `mesh.hlsl`,
  `MeshBuilder`. Phase 4 Tasks 1–8 are all render-layer with no scene
  dependency and survive this pivot intact.

### Three consequences the file list makes unavoidable

1. **This is a plugin ABI break — but by recompilation, not by layout.**
   `Transform` does *not* appear structurally in `Plugin/PluginABI.hpp`; the
   only reference there is the changelog line for **v7 (2026-07-24): "LocalTransform
   renamed to Transform"**. That line is the precedent, though: a game module
   compiles against `Components.hpp`, so changing `Transform`'s layout requires
   every consumer to recompile, and the project treated a *rename* of this same
   type as ABI-relevant. ABI goes 15 → 16 and every consuming `.arcproj` needs
   restamping — the chore already visible in Gacha's history
   (`chore(game): restamp Aphelyon.arcproj to engine ABI 15`). Standing direction
   is that ABI bumps are cheap during engine development.
2. **The scene format changes, but the serializer probably does not.**
   `SceneSerializer.hpp:7` describes itself as driven by a **descriptor factory
   "instead of a hardcoded Transform+SpriteRenderer pair"** — it serializes
   through reflection. So the on-disk shape follows the reflected fields
   automatically and the serializer needs little or no editing. What changes is
   that **old files no longer load**, which is what makes the clean-break
   decision cheap rather than what makes it expensive.
3. **The inspector already handles `glm::vec3`; the quaternion is the new work.**
   `ArcaneEditor/src/Panels/InspectorFields.cpp:39-40,216-220` already registers
   `TypeID<glm::vec3>` / `TypeID<glm::vec4>` and draws them. No equivalent exists
   for `glm::quat`. That is the one genuinely new inspector field type F1 needs —
   presenting Euler angles over quaternion storage, with the existing
   `ASTRA_REFLECT_ATTR(AngleFormat, Radians)` on the current scalar `rotation`
   as the precedent for how angle presentation is already expressed.

---

## The hierarchy traversal problem

Found while reviewing the above, and it changes F1's shape.

`Relations::ForEachDescendant` (`Astra/Registry/Relations.hpp:158`) **copies the
entire traversal cache by value on every call**:

```cpp
auto cache = m_relationsGraph->GetDescendantsCached(m_rootEntity);   // :165
```

`GetDescendantsCached` (`RelationshipGraph.hpp:759`) returns `TraversalCache`
**by value, under a `std::shared_mutex`** — and the comment there explains why it
must: the caches live in a non-pointer-stable `FlatMap`, so a concurrent insert
can rehash and dangle any reference that escapes the lock. It is a correct safety
decision that is simply wrong for a per-frame path.

So before a single matrix multiply, transform propagation pays a shared-mutex
lock, a hash lookup, and **a heap allocation plus a full copy of every entity in
the scene**. Then, per entity, four random-access lookups:
`GetComponent<Transform>`, `GetComponent<WorldTransform>`, `GetParent`,
`GetComponent<WorldTransform>(parent)`. That is the opposite of what an ECS is
fast at.

`TransformSystems.hpp` calls it **twice per frame** — `:45` to collect entities
needing a `WorldTransform`, `:59` to propagate. Two full copies per frame.

**The problem is bounded.** Every traversal caller in the engine:

| Caller | Frequency | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `Scene/TransformSystems.hpp:45,59` | **every frame** | the problem |
| `Serialization/SceneSerializer.hpp:72` | save / load | fine |
| `ArcaneEditor Panels/EditorPanels.cpp:1467` | UI interaction | fine |
| `ArcaneEditor Scene/SelectionOps.hpp:30` | user selection | fine |

One hot-path caller; the other three are per-user-action, where a copy costs
nothing.

### The fix: decouple structure from values

Hierarchy is **structural** and changes rarely. Transform **values** change every
frame. Today both are recomputed together, per frame. They should not be.

- Arcane owns a flat, topologically sorted `order` array plus a `parentIndex`
  array (index into `order`; a sentinel for roots), rebuilt **only when Astra's
  `m_structureVersion` changes** — that version already exists and already drives
  Astra's own cache invalidation.
- Per frame becomes a linear pass:
  `world[i] = parentIndex[i] == kRoot ? local[i] : world[parentIndex[i]] * local[i]`.
  Parents precede children, so the parent's world matrix is already final. Two
  packed arrays, sequential access, no locks, no map lookups, no copies.
- Dirty flags so untouched subtrees are skipped entirely — in most scenes, most
  of them.

This is substantially what Unity DOTS does with hierarchy-depth grouping and
`LocalToWorld`.

**Where the fix belongs.** A non-copying cached traversal is *generic ECS
capability*, and the standing direction is that generic capability is built in
the lower layer rather than worked around above it (Mosaic / Astra / Manifold2D →
Arcane → editor). So **Astra** should expose the structure version and a build
path that does not copy; the topological order, the dirty policy, and the
definition of "spatial" are **Arcane's** and stay here. The Astra-first vendoring
workflow applies: commit in the Astra repo, then `scripts\sync-astra.ps1`.

## The foundations, in dependency order

### F1 — the transform spine

The type change **and** the propagation rework. They belong together:
`TransformSystems.hpp` is being rewritten for `mat4` regardless, and porting the
type change through a propagation algorithm already known to be wrong is wasted
work.

| Type | From | To |
|---|---|---|
| `Transform` | vec2 pos, float rot, vec2 scale | **vec3 pos, quaternion rot, vec3 scale** |
| `Transform::ToMatrix` | `glm::mat3` | `glm::mat4` |
| `WorldTransform` | `glm::mat3` | `glm::mat4` |
| `PreviousTransform` | vec2 + float | **vec3 + quaternion** |

`PreviousTransform`'s interpolation changes character, not just type. Its current
contract (`Components.hpp:46-51`) is explicit that it is *"decomposed (position +
angle) so rotation interpolates on the shortest arc, NOT by lerping matrix
components."* The 3D equivalent of that intent is **SLERP** on the quaternion —
`glm::slerp`, not a component-wise lerp, and not a matrix lerp. Preserving the
stated intent is what makes this a port rather than a rewrite.

Rotation representation should be **quaternion in storage**, with Euler angles
presented at the inspector via reflection attributes. That is what UE
(`FTransform` holding `FQuat`), Unity, and Godot all do, and it avoids gimbal
lock in the stored data while keeping authoring legible.

**Physics stays 2D and operates on the XY plane of the 3D transform.** This is
the correct degenerate case, not a compromise: `PhysicsSystem` writes back
position/rotation, and doing so into `.xy` and the Z-axis rotation of a 3D
transform is exactly what a 2D simulation in a 3D world means. It also keeps a
57-file type change from colliding with a physics migration.

**And the propagation rework**, per "The hierarchy traversal problem" above:
`TransformSystems` stops calling `ForEachDescendant` per frame and instead owns a
topologically sorted `order` + `parentIndex` pair rebuilt only on structure
change, with a linear per-frame pass and dirty-flag skipping. The two current
traversals collapse to zero on a steady-state frame. Astra gains whatever minimal
surface that needs (structure version, non-copying build); the ordering and dirty
policy stay in Arcane.

### F2 — 3D vocabulary in the scene

A `MeshRenderer` component, and mesh + material as **assets** rather than
side-channel data. This is where the asset cook arc
(`docs/research/2026-08-21-asset-cook-pipeline-design.md`) stops being optional:
without it, 3D content cannot be authored, saved, or reopened.

Note the ordering dependency with the render layer: Phase 4's `BindlessTable`
hands out descriptor slots, but it does not know what a *material* is. F2 is
where that gets defined, and a material asset design should precede or accompany
any further bindless work.

### F3 — what a 3D renderer needs that a 2D one did not

**There is no frustum culling and no bounds anywhere** in `Render/` or `Scene/`.
`RenderGraph.hpp:33` states it outright: the graph *"does not reorder, cull, or"*
otherwise reorganize. For a handful of sprite batches that is a reasonable
non-feature. For 3D scenes it is not optional:

- per-mesh local AABB, computed at build/cook time
- world-space bounds derived through the transform
- frustum culling against the camera
- draw sorting — opaque front-to-back for early-Z, transparent back-to-front

### F4 — editor authoring for 3D

- The gizmo is 2D (`Edit/Gizmo.{cpp,hpp}`, already in F1's blast radius) and
  needs 3D translate/rotate/scale.
- `Viewport/EditorCamera.{cpp,hpp}` is where orbit/fly controls belong. Note the
  editor already has its own camera distinct from the scene `Camera` component —
  this is the seam that makes camera *pose* tractable ahead of a full 3D
  camera-component story.
- 3D picking **may already work**: picking is a GPU id-buffer read
  (`Render/PickEmit`), not a 2D math path. **Verify rather than assume** — this
  could be free or could be a whole item.

### F5 — the compositing architecture

Two coupled changes:

1. **Hoist the clear to a declarative attachment load-op.** Today
   `Batch2DNode::Record` issues `CmdClearAttachments` mid-pass
   (`Batch2DNode.cpp:1321-1325`), with the intent stated as *"the only node that
   clears the canvas at all, so there is exactly one background colour in the
   process."* `NriGraphContext.cpp:1123-1163` already records the declarative
   clear-op as deferred work. This is how both D3D12 and Vulkan want it
   expressed, and it is faster on tiled hardware.
2. **One world pass with a shared depth buffer** that 3D geometry and 2D world
   content both sort into.

Until (1) exists, node ordering is forced: anything declared before `batch2d` is
erased by its clear, and anything after composites on top. That is why 3D
currently draws over `Batcher2D` content. ImGui UI is unaffected — `gameui` and
`hostHud` are declared after the tonemap, which is where UI belongs.

## Physics — decided

**Vendor Box3D**, but **not until F1 has landed.**

[Box3D](https://github.com/erincatto/box3d) — Erin Catto, released 2026-06-30.
MIT, C17 with a clean C API, forked from the Box2D codebase. Cross-platform
determinism, SIMD contact solving, multithreading, triangle-mesh and heightfield
collision, large worlds. In production in Facepunch's s&box and the Esoterica
engine.

Chosen over Jolt for three reasons specific to this engine:

1. **Heritage from Valve's Rubikon** — Source 2's physics engine — aligning with
   a Deadlock-class renderer target.
2. **It is a Box2D fork.** Box2D v3.1.1 is already vendored here as *the parity
   citation source* for Manifold2D. Box3D slots into precisely that role for a
   future Manifold3D: same author, same methodology, continuous architecture.
   Jolt would mean learning an unrelated design and later porting away from it.
3. **C17 with a C API** matches the existing vendoring shape — no nested build
   system, consistent with the stated preference for vendoring over package
   managers.

**Accepted risk:** Box3D is **v0.1 with no API stability guarantees**, roughly
seven weeks old at time of writing; breaking changes are expected, and the
near-term roadmap is character movement, ghost collisions, and the joint solver.
Jolt is the mature alternative (Horizon Forbidden West, Godot 4) and would be
the correct choice under a near-term ship date. Vendoring plus a self-controlled
update cadence is what makes the v0.1 risk acceptable here.

---

## Decisions taken 2026-08-21

1. **Scene file migration: CLEAN BREAK.** No upgrade path, no version shim. The
   corpus is **two authored scenes** — `ReferenceProject/Content/scenes/main.arcscene`
   and Gacha's `Game/Content/scenes/test.arcscene` (the other five `.arcscene`
   hits on disk are build-output copies). Re-authoring two files, one of them
   named `test`, is cheaper than an upgrade path written once, run once, and
   maintained forever. Consistent with the project's existing schema convention
   — *"edit-and-rebuild rather than write-numbered-migrations… the
   trail-of-tears in git log is the migration history."*
2. **Phase 4 Task 8 (bindless material table): HELD**, not cancelled. It has no
   scene dependency, but F2 is where materials become assets, and a bindless
   table's *policy* — capacity, slot lifetime, eviction, write-once vs per-frame
   descriptors — falls out of how materials load and stream. The *mechanism* is
   invariant; the policy is not. Task 7's fix round already deleted ~135 lines of
   guessed-ahead binding code for exactly this reason; building the table before
   F2 would repeat that at one task's remove.
3. **Orthographic camera path must survive F1 byte-identically.** It is
   `glm::vec2`-shaped throughout and is the path every existing 2D scene uses.
   This is an explicit F1 requirement, as it was in Phase 4 Task 5.

## Still open

**Does `SpriteRenderer` stay 2D-positioned, or become a world quad in 3D space?**

Not required for F1 — F1's requirement is only that sprites keep rendering
*exactly* as they do today, reading `position.xy` and the Z-axis rotation from a
3D transform. But it is required before F5, and it is what resolves the
compositing question properly instead of by an ordering rule.

**Recommendation:** make it a world object with a 3D transform, drawn into the
same depth buffer as meshes. Sprites here are already world content — MKS meters,
an orthographic camera in meters, sprite shapes deliberately matched to collider
shapes. Unity and Godot both treat sprites as world objects with a Z and keep
screen-space UI a separate system; this engine already *has* that separate system
in ImGui-after-tonemap. Whether a given sprite billboards toward the camera
should be a per-sprite flag, not a global decision.

---

## Recommended sequencing

1. **F1 alone** — the transform spine, gate green at every step, nothing else
   moving. ABI 15 → 16. Scene format decision applied.
2. **F2** — `MeshRenderer` + mesh/material assets, with the cook pipeline.
3. **F3** — bounds, frustum culling, draw sorting.
4. **F5** — declarative clear-op and the unified world pass.
5. **F4** alongside F2/F3 as authoring catches up.
6. **Box3D** after F1, as its own arc.
7. **Phase 4's Task 9** then becomes trivially correct, because the scene will
   have meshes to submit.

---

## What Phase 4 leaves behind

Tasks 1–8 stand. Two items pass to whoever picks this up:

- **Two desk-check items** that no automated signal in this repo can reach: the
  `frontCounterClockwise = true` + `CullMode::BACK` pair (derivation verified
  algebraically but never executed), and the fact that **the depth-attachment
  path has never run anywhere in this tree** — three `RenderGraphExec.cpp` sites
  go live with the mesh pass.
- **Task 10's desk checklist needs rewording.** Its camera-orbit item is
  unperformable (projection without pose), and its *"the game UI in Play still
  composites"* item names the ImGui half that works rather than the `Batcher2D`
  half that does not — as worded it would produce a false pass.
