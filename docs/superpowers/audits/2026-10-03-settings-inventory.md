# Settings inventory (read-only audit, 2026-10-03)

**Status:** first pass, for the user's review (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-settings-and-cvar-completion-design.md`, s10 and s16.3). Nothing was changed in code. Three read-only audits ran in parallel, one per part below.

**How to review:**
- Skim the SETTING rows. Correct any verdict, name, audience (Editor/Game/PlayerSafe/Server, +Dev), scope (Preferences/Project) or apply mode (Live/NextWorld/Restart) you disagree with.
- Mark rows directly in this file, or tell me "row X: ...".
- S5 of the plan finalizes this file with your corrections before any conversion starts.

## Summary

| Part | SETTING | CONSTANT | DERIVED |
|---|---|---|---|
| Part 1: ArcaneCore and the vendored library configs | 85 | 99 | 27 |
| Part 2: ArcaneClient, ArcaneRuntime, ArcaneServer, ArcaneCrashReporter | 141 | 96 | 28 |
| Part 3: ArcaneEditor and ArcaneHub | 255 | 38 | 56 |
| **Total** | **481** | **233** | **111** |

These counts are rows by verdict, so a grouped row (e.g. "keepalive idle / interval / probes") counts once. Part 3 also has a separate shortcut table, which is not in the counts.

## Should anything NOT be exposed? (spec s16.8)

**Yes.** About a third of the candidates are real constants. Changing them would break a file, a protocol or a shader, or would be a bug. Merged across all three parts, the categories are:

1. **File, report and blob formats:** artifact magic/version, scene JSON version, snapshot magic, VerifyReport schema, ini section names, recents format versions. This also covers authored-data defaults that an absent JSON key resolves to (Camera, Fixture, Sprite pivot, mesh topology).
2. **Wire and process protocols:** message-id ranges, the length-prefix width, watchdog/reporter exit codes, window-message ids, drag-drop and clipboard payload keys.
3. **Shader/HLSL contracts:** bindless capacity, cull thread-group size, cbuffer slots and packing, Vulkan binding offsets, max selected ids, instance flag bits.
4. **ABI:** the plugin ABI version and entry names, cvar flag bits, InputSnapshot arrays, RenderGraph handle bits, D3D12SDKVersion.
5. **Hardware, OS and graphics-API limits:** feature level 12_0, Vulkan 1.3, SM 6.5, 256-byte cbuffer alignment, the OS console-close cap, path length rules, max texture size.
6. **Static crash-path capacity:** the crash arena, frame/buffer limits, the log backlog ring and the module table. The crash path cannot allocate or read cvars.
7. **Math identities and float tolerances:** pi/tau, FNV constants, Rec.709 and sRGB/WCAG transfer constants, epsilons, the camera pitch lock.
8. **Security and crypto:** salt/hash length, entropy sample size, log-preview truncation (widening it leaks tokens), RFC 4122 bits, the runtime console's player permission.
9. **Test oracles and automation:** the ImageCompare cascade, settle intervals, fault-injector values, run-input flags (`--frames`, `--probe`).
10. **ID spaces and sentinels:** node/pin id bases, 0xFFFFFFFF markers, fixed preview GUIDs.
11. **Vendored-library compile-time constants:** Manifold2D `kLinearSlop`, `kMaxRotation`. Changing them forks the library.
12. **Values whose change would be a bug:** DRED always on, memory zero-init off, `Theme::kNone`, the dock split clamp, the permanent Viewport panel.

So a guard that fails on EVERY new number constant would be wrong. The recommended guard form is in s16.8 / s10.3 (a): a new constant is either a setting or carries an `ARC_CONSTANT("why")` marker.

## Findings that need the user's eyes

**Spec corrections:**
- **Manifold2D has no gravity setter.** Gravity cannot be Live without a Manifold2D change, which is Manifold2D-first, then a re-vendor.
- **`sim.fixedHz` must be NextWorld:** PhysicsSystem captures dt at creation.
- **The shortcut counts are wrong.** There are about 49 ImGui key checks in 11 files, plus 22 raw-scancode bindings and 7 keys inside the vendored node editor.
- **New categories to add** to s5.2: audio, app.splash, boot, console, runtime, sim, debug.physics, assets.thumbnail.

**Decisions:**
- **Shortcut keys: physical or logical?** The viewport/camera keys read SDL scancodes, which are physical positions (on AZERTY, "W" is the Z key). Everything else reads ImGui keys, which are logical. Recommendation:
  - commands bind logical keys, which match their labels;
  - fly-camera movement binds physical keys, which keep the WASD shape.
- **UI scale.** About 60 hard pixel sizes ignore font size and scale. Recommendation: derive them from one `editor.ui.scale` multiplier instead of about 100 individual Dev cvars.
- **Second stores:**
  - the `.arcproj` `physics.gravity` and splash blocks;
  - `protocol.json` `settings` (ports, caps, timeouts);
  - the Hub's `settings.archub`.

  Recommendation: `.arcproj` physics/splash move to `Config/<category>.json`, and identity stays in `.arcproj`. `protocol.json` settings become `net.*` cvars, with protocol.json read as a Project rung during migration. The Hub keeps its own store, with a JSON bridge later.
- **Capacity hints** (reserve sizes, I/O chunk sizes) were marked SETTING Dev by the "when in doubt" rule. Recommendation: make them CONSTANT with a marker.

**Bugs and gaps found, outside settings** (to queue separately):
- **Possible security issue:** `Message::ToString` logs up to 100 chars of the payload, which for Login/Register may include a plaintext password (Protocol.hpp:413). Check where ToString is logged (Aphelyon server).
- **Debug HUD in shipped builds:** the runtime debug HUD draws in every configuration, including Dist.
- **The parallel physics solver is never enabled:** `PhysicsWorld::SetExecutor` is never called.
- **`log.level` never reaches Astra/Manifold2D logs:** `Mosaic::SetLogLevel` is never called.
- **Physics debug arrows are 20 m and 28 m long** (pre-metres leftovers).
- **Sprite-texture overflow passes silently:** it flattens sprites, logs one ERROR, and still exits 0.
- **Every game uses engine identity:** the window is titled "Arcane Runtime", the base input context is "demo", and it boots on the engine splash.
- **No player settings exist yet:** fullscreen, display mode, master volume. Spatial audio is forced off.
- **Menus show wrong shortcuts:** Redo shows only Ctrl+Y; Rename/Delete only fire with the Outliner focused.
- **The same default is spelled in several places:** the fixed step in 6 places (one with a digit fewer), the shader debounce in 3, and the preview light in 2 different ways. The sweep deletes the copies.
- **Unbounded growth:** the Console's line buffer grows without bound, and diagnostics reports have no retention.

- Manifold2D `WorldDef`: Core/Base/Runtime.cpp:452-455. Sets only `gravityX/Y`.
- enkiTS `TaskSchedulerConfig`: Core/Jobs/JobSystem.cpp:102-107.
- Astra `Registry::Save()`: Core/Base/Runtime.cpp:318, with default `SaveConfig`.
- Mosaic: Core/Base/Log.cpp:248-249 sets only the sink and the assert handler.

### Should NOT be exposed

- **File-format, artifact and blob constants:** `ArtifactReader.cpp:15-37` (artifact magic, version, entry sizes); `SceneSerializer.hpp:97` `kSceneJsonVersion=6`; `RegistrySnapshot.hpp:37-38` snapshot magic and version. This group also covers authored-data struct defaults that an absent JSON key resolves to: Camera `Components.hpp:264-269`, Fixture `PhysicsComponents.hpp:103-115`, Sprite pivot `SpriteAsset.hpp:45` (sparse write), mesh topology `MeshAsset.hpp:96-105`, ResolvedMeshMaterial `SceneResources.hpp:288-291`.
- **Wire protocol:** `Protocol.hpp:213` uint16 id range; `:426-427` request/response partition at 100; `TcpSocket.hpp:440` length-prefix width.
- **Shader contract and HLSL packing:** `GlobalParams.hpp:16-25` cbuffer/texture slots; `MaterialSource.hpp:88` `kMaxPassInputs=4`; `MaterialTemplate.cpp:13` `kRegister=16`.
- **ABI:** `PluginABI.hpp:1043` `kGamePluginABIVersion`; `:1084-1094` entry names; `CVarTypes.hpp:36-46` flag bits; `Diagnostics.hpp:175-178` exit codes (a monitor/CI contract).
- **Hardware, OS and Win32:** `Diagnostics.cpp:2228` 4 s console-close cap; `:1810` 64 KiB stack guarantee; `NativeWindow.cpp:236` 96 DPI baseline; `Toolchain.cpp:54-56` path separator.
- **Static crash-path capacity** (cannot allocate or read cvars on the crash path): `CrashArena.hpp:46` 256 KiB; `Diagnostics.cpp:225-231` frame/buffer limits; `Log.hpp:77-78` backlog ring; `ModuleTable.hpp:71`.
- **Math identities and float tolerances:** `PhysicsSystem.hpp:213-214` pi/tau; `ViewTransform.hpp:70` 1e-12; `Frustum.hpp`; `Aabb.hpp:26`; `kAuthorPosEps/RotEps`; `kSpriteDepthEpsilon` (also golden-bound).
- **Security and crypto:** `Crypto.hpp:53-54` salt and hash length; `:178` entropy sample; `Protocol.hpp:410-413` log-preview truncation (widening leaks tokens and passwords); RFC 4122 bits in `Guid.cpp`.
- **Test oracle / ported algorithm:** the whole `ImageCompare.*` cascade (dE94 JND, 31x31 SSIM, 0.99, 10x10 grid).
- **Decoder/importer capability lists and layout conventions:** `AssetRegistry.cpp:36/185` and `Assets.cpp:1078-1096` extension lists; `Project.cpp:408` folder set; `Saved/Config`, `Saved/editor.lock`, `data/EngineConfig`; the `.session` name pattern.
- **Vendored-library compile-time constants:** Manifold2D `kLinearSlop`, `kMaxRotation` (`PhysicsTypes.hpp:146-150`).

### Notes

1. **The physics solver never gets the job system.** `PhysicsWorld::SetExecutor` (PhysicsWorld.hpp:549) is called nowhere outside ThirdParty/docs. Runtime::EnsurePhysics (Runtime.cpp:452-455) builds every world serial, even though Runtime owns a JobSystem. The Phase-D1 parallel solver is unreachable in shipped hosts.
2. **Manifold2D has no gravity setter.** The spec s5.2 says "gravity Live (a library setter exists)", but there is no `SetGravity`. Today a gravity change replaces the whole world (Runtime.cpp:444-455) and re-mints all bodies. The binding should declare that honestly, or Manifold2D needs a setter (Manifold2D-first, then re-vendor).
3. **Gravity has at least four stores or copies:**
   - the `.arcproj` `physics.gravity` block (ProjectManifest.hpp:58, a second store outside the cvar registry);
   - the new-project stamp at Project.cpp:428;
   - the per-scene PhysicsSettings component default at Components.hpp:213;
   - the fallback at Runtime.cpp:429.

   The `.arcproj` splash block (ProjectManifest.hpp:36-50) is the same kind of second store. Spec s3.1 says no setting has a second store, so the arc must decide whether the manifest stays as the Project rung or migrates to `Config/<category>.json`.
4. **`sim.fixedHz` cannot be Live today.** `RunLoop::SetFixedHz` (RunLoop.hpp:92) changes the loop step. But PhysicsSystem captured `fixedDt` at AddSystem (Runtime.cpp:418), and `PhysicsEditPass` reads Runtime's own `loopCfg` copy (Runtime.cpp:105, :461). Calling SetFixedHz now desyncs the physics step from the loop. The setting must be NextWorld, or the binding must rebuild PhysicsSystem.
5. **The log level does not reach vendored code.** Arcane never calls `Mosaic::SetLogLevel`. Mosaic's level is a per-module inline atomic defaulting to Info (Mosaic/Log.hpp:100), so the `log.level` cvar never reaches Astra or Manifold2D log output. Each module (Core, Client, host) has its own copy, so the binding must set it in every module, the same way Log.cpp:248 mirrors the sink.
6. **Shadow copies the sweep must delete:**
   - ConsoleModel.cpp:10 (64)
   - Diagnostics.cpp:3032 (60 s)
   - SpriteAsset.cpp:108 (100)
   - SceneCamera.hpp:210-212 (dead initialisers)
   - Project.cpp:428 (gravity)
   - the extension lists duplicated between Assets.cpp:1078/1095 and AssetRegistry.cpp:36/185 (the comment admits "mirrors it exactly")
7. **Second stores on the server side.** `protocol.json` `settings` (Protocol.hpp:168-185) already holds port, max message size, token length, session and idle timeouts, and connection caps. Its code-side fallbacks (`ServerConfig::MAX_CONNECTIONS_*`) and the duplicates (`MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` versus `max_message_size`; `HasToken() >= 64` versus `token_length`) make it a second settings store.
8. **Possible security issue: `Message::ToString` logs up to 100 characters of the payload** (Protocol.hpp:413). For Login/Register payloads that likely includes the plaintext password. It is worth checking where ToString is logged. Mosaic's level gap (note 5) aside, this is the only security-relevant finding.
9. **Missing caps and retention, not literals:**
   - `ConsoleModel::m_lines` (ConsoleModel.hpp:45) grows without bound; candidate `console.maxLines`.
   - The diagnostics report directory has no retention or pruning at all; candidate `diagnostics.maxReports`. Engine logs rotate (keep=5), reports do not.
10. **Two logging stacks with different policies.** Engine `Log` uses rename rotation with keep=5, truncate, and flush on warn. Server-facing `Util/Logger.hpp` uses spdlog rotating 5 MiB x 3 and flushes on info. They need two settings families or a unification decision.
11. **Most Core tunables are parameter-struct defaults whose real value is picked by a caller outside Core.** Examples: `Diagnostics::Config`, `AssetsDesc`, `JobSystem(threads)`, `NativeWindowDesc`, `RateLimiter::Config`, `EnableTcpKeepAlive` defaults, the `WriteThumbnailPngRgba` width. The binding belongs at the creation site (the Runtime ctor, host mains, the Aphelyon Server), not in the struct. Changing the struct default would also be an ABI change for the exported ones.
12. **`Sim/Simulation.hpp` is dead code.** Nothing includes it, and it carries a fourth `Registry::Config` construction path. Delete it, or route it through the single `ToAstraConfig` binding.
13. **Astra `maxChunks = 4096` is a hard world-size ceiling** that nobody sets. Also, `EntityTable::Config::releaseThreshold` is serialized (EntityManager.hpp:335) but I found no consumer in Astra, so exposing it would be a placebo until Astra uses it.
14. **Library defaults diverge from engine defaults.** Manifold2D's `BodyDef.friction` is 0.4 versus Arcane's `Fixture.friction` 0.3. `WorldDef` gravity is (0,+10) y-down versus Arcane's (0,-9.81) y-up. Arcane always overrides both, so behaviour is correct, but the binding tests should pin these explicitly.
15. **The PBKDF2 iteration count is flagged in source as "bump before Release launch or 2027"** (Crypto.hpp:45-50). As a floor-clamped Server setting, the rollout is already handled by lazy rehash.
16. **Env-var toggles bypass the cvar store.** `ARCANE_BUILD_MACHINE`, `CI` and `ARCANE_ALLOW_REPORTER_ON_BUILD_MACHINE` (Diagnostics.cpp:2610) toggle reporter spawning. It is worth deciding whether env becomes a documented rung or a `--set` alias.
17. **Crash-path values must be snapshotted at Install.** Any crash-path value converted to a setting (minidump kind, flush timeout, min fatal wait) has to be copied into `g_cfg` at `Install`. The crash thread must never consult the registry.

## Part 2: ArcaneClient, ArcaneRuntime, ArcaneServer, ArcaneCrashReporter

### Hard-coded tunables in ArcaneClient, ArcaneRuntime, ArcaneServer and ArcaneCrashReporter (read-only audit, 2026-10-03, against spec sections 3, 5 and 10)

**Conventions used in the tables**
- Paths are relative to `D:\dev\starworks\Arcane\`.
- `—` means the field does not apply. CONSTANT rows always give their reason in the "why" column.
- **Command-line flags:** a flag that is a per-run input, not something anyone would tune (`--project`, `--frames`, `--probe` and so on), is marked CONSTANT with "FLAG ONLY" in the why column. That means "stays a flag, gets no cvar". Rows that say "BOTH" keep the flag and add a cvar.
- **Capacity hints** (reserve sizes, I/O chunk sizes) are marked SETTING Dev because of the "when in doubt" rule. The Notes recommend putting them on the allow-list instead.

  - kInvalidMaterialId 0xFFFF (Batcher2D.hpp:210).

### Notes
- **Only two cvars exist in all four directories:** `render.meshCull` (MeshCullNode.cpp:21) and `diagnostics.drawMarkers` (GpuInstrumentation.cpp:27). Everything else in the tables is hard-coded.
- **Gizmo snap steps can't be changed:** the editor only ever sets `GizmoSnap::enabled` (EditorAppFrame.cpp:1303-1304). Nobody can change the 0.5 m, 15° and 0.1 steps (Gizmo.hpp:95-97). This is the clearest missing preference.
- **Debug HUD always shows:** the "ArcaneRuntime" debug HUD is drawn every frame in every configuration, including Dist (RuntimeApp.cpp:810, RuntimeFrame.cpp:302). Shipped games show it. Because goldens include it, the cvar default must stay on unless someone re-blesses on purpose.
- **Physics debug lengths look like pre-metres leftovers:** kManifoldNormalLen 20 and kNormalLen 28 are labelled "world units" (PhysicsDebugDraw.cpp:138, :747). With metres as the unit, those arrows are 20 m and 28 m long. The contactMarkerSize comment (PhysicsDebugDraw.hpp:72) still cites pixelsPerMeter=100. Convert byte-identically, but treat these as bug candidates.
- **The same default is written in several places and will drift:**
  - **Fixed step 1/60:** HostConfig.hpp:73; HostConfig.cpp:96 as the string "0.0166666666666666666"; ServerConfig.hpp:22; ServerConfig.cpp:56 as "0.016666666666666666" (one digit fewer); OffscreenImGuiLayer.hpp:58; plus Core's RunLoop 60 Hz.
  - **Shader debounce 0.2:** RuntimeApp.cpp:311, ShaderCompiler.cpp:405 and ShaderCompiler.hpp:111.
  - **15 s fence/poll window:** in three files, silently tied to Core's 8 s gpuStallSeconds.
  - **kHangMainSeconds 15:** tied to Core's 12 s hangSeconds.
  - **ProjectBoot kStride:** copied by hand into EditorAppProject.cpp.
  - **Preview light:** the triple appears twice, plus a third, different triple in MeshDocument.
  - **UndoLimits:** its defaults repeat the editor.undo.* cvar defaults.
- **Frames in flight is the biggest conversion:** kSwapchainFramesInFlight has 167 references and sizes 36 fixed arrays, and every descriptor-pool size depends on it. Converting it needs a kMaxFramesInFlight CONSTANT for storage plus a runtime render.framesInFlight setting capped by it.
- **Project identity is hard-coded:**
  - Every project's base input context is "demo" (ProjectBoot.hpp:120).
  - Every game's window is titled "Arcane Runtime" (GpuContext.cpp:25), even though the reporter's product name already comes from the project.
  - Every game boots on the engine logo splash (ArcaneRuntime/src/main.cpp:212).
- **Almost nothing exists yet for players (PlayerSafe):**
  - There is no fullscreen or display-mode setting, no resolution beyond window size, and no master volume.
  - Spatial audio is forced off (AudioDevice.cpp:654).
  - The natural PlayerSafe candidates are backend, vsync, window size, anisotropy, adapter, tearing, audio channels and deadzones.
- **Shader compiles can't be debugged at source level:** compiles pass no `-O` or `-Zi` (ShaderCompiler.cpp:270-288) and run on a single worker thread.
- **Release can't turn on validation:** Release and Dist builds have no way to enable GPU validation without recompiling (RenderDeviceDesc.hpp:20-24, NriGraphContext.cpp:175-183).
- **Sprite-texture overflow passes silently:** going past kMaxSpriteTextures turns sprites into flat tint, logs one ERROR, and still exits 0 (Batch2DNode.hpp:255-262). That is a strong reason to expose it.
- **Defaults that move goldens:** these must keep identical defaults during the sweep and only change with a deliberate re-bless:
  - window 1280x720
  - kCanvasClear
  - the mesh default light triple
  - kPickSupersample
  - outline colours and widths
  - canvas format
  - shader debounce (it moves the settle frame)
  - runtime HUD visibility
  - grid colours
  - thumbnail size, light, time and FOV
- **Thumbnails are not in the four audited directories:** they live in ArcaneEditor (MaterialPreviewHarvester.cpp:44, 55, 1237, 1257-1259). The only in-scope part is MeshSceneDesc's default light at MeshNode.hpp:297-299.
- **The crash reporter has no settings store:** ArcaneCrashReporter is a separate exe without a CVarRegistry. Its settings would have to travel from the host's diagnostics category through command-line arguments, the way `--deadline` already does.
- **No network settings yet:** ArcaneServer has no ports, timeouts or rate limits. Tick rate is its only tunable, so the `net.*` category is empty in this scope.
- **New category names:** the proposals use `audio.*`, `app.splash.*`, `boot.*`, `console.*`, `runtime.*`, `sim.*`, `debug.physics.*` and `assets.thumbnail.*`, which spec section 5.2 does not list. The spec should either add them or fold them into existing ones.
- **Capacity hints:** reserve sizes and I/O chunks (MeshNode.hpp:645, CommandStack.cpp:111, ComponentEditCommand.cpp:34, ShaderCompiler.cpp:244, AudioDevice.cpp:361) are marked SETTING Dev only because of the "when in doubt" rule. I recommend putting them on the reviewed-CONSTANT allow-list rather than making them cvars.

## Part 3: ArcaneEditor and ArcaneHub

## Settings inventory: ArcaneEditor + ArcaneHub (read-only audit, 2026-10-03)

Paths are relative to `D:\dev\starworks\Arcane\ArcaneEditor\src\` unless they start with `ArcaneHub/`, `ArcaneClient/` or `ArcaneCore/`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-settings-and-cvar-completion-design.md` (s3, s6, s7, s10). The audit only read files; nothing was edited, built or run.

Column key:
- **aud**: audience.
- **scope**: `Pref-M` = Preferences, machine-wide (EditorUser rung). `Pref-P` = Preferences, per project (User rung under `Saved/Config`). `Project` = Project rung.
- **det**: Y if changing the value changes a simulation's outcome or replays.
- **—**: not applicable.

### Persistence stores

What the editor and the Hub persist today, and where:

| Store | What it persists | Where | Code | Proposed fate (s10.2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Should NOT be exposed

- **File, ini and wire formats; payload and clipboard ids**
  - ini section names: `ViewportSettings::kIniType/kIniName` (Viewport/ViewportSettings.hpp:72-73), `kPanelsIniType/Name` (App/EditorApp.cpp:259-260), `kInstancesIniType/Name` (Panels/InspectorWindows.cpp:507-508).
  - Format versions: `RecentProjects kFormatVersion` (Project/RecentProjects.cpp:30), `SceneRecents::kFormatVersion` (Project/SceneRecents.hpp:32), Hub `STATE_FORMAT_VERSION` (ArcaneHub/src-tauri/src/store.rs:34).
  - Drag-drop and clipboard keys: `kAssetDragType "ARCANE_ASSET"` (Panels/AssetPanelModel.hpp:81), `kDragPayload "ARC_INPUT_ROW"` (Documents/InputActionsDocumentWidgets.cpp:21), `kOutlinerDragType` (Panels/EditorPanels.cpp:1572), `kEntityClipboardKey` (Scene/EntityClipboard.hpp:17).
- **OS, hardware and ABI limits**
  - SDL scancode values (App/EditorAppFrame.cpp:95-137). Rebinding changes which code an action uses, never the codes themselves.
  - `D3D12SDKVersion = 619` (main.cpp:43) and `kAppUserModelId` (main.cpp:36).
  - Path and filename rules: `kCreateNameMaxPathChars 240` (Panels/CreateAssetDialog.hpp:332), `kDenied` filename chars (:351).
  - Texture limit: Max Size 16384 (Panels/TextureImportSettings.cpp:74).
  - Windows API values: SHFileOperation flags (Project/OsShell.cpp:198), ShellExecute return codes (Project/OsShell.cpp:71-73).
- **Library mirrors and API contracts**
  - `kNavigationZoomMargin 0.1` (Widgets/GraphFit.cpp:44) and `kGraphLinkChannel 7` (Widgets/GraphWire.hpp:72).
  - `ed::Config::SettingsFile = nullptr` (Documents/ShaderEditorDocument.cpp:3358, :4824; Panels/AssetGraphPanel.cpp:1323). This is the no-canvas-persistence ruling.
- **Math identities and numeric guards**
  - `kPi` (Widgets/GraphWire.hpp:148) and the Bezier weights 3.0 (Widgets/GraphWire.hpp:84-85).
  - The sRGB and WCAG transfer constants (Widgets/EditorWidgets.cpp:1374-1382; Widgets/EditorTheme.hpp:64-65).
  - The pitch lock 90−1e-3 (Viewport/ViewportSettings.hpp:69; Viewport/EditorCamera.cpp:73) and the FOV bounds 1..179 (Viewport/ViewportSettings.hpp:63-64).
  - Epsilons: Widgets/GraphGridPhase.hpp:97, Widgets/GraphNodeLod.hpp:79, Panels/InspectorFields.cpp:390. The framing radius floor at Viewport/EditorCamera.cpp:131.
- **ID spaces, sentinels and fixed GUIDs**
  - Node and pin id bases: `kPassOutputNodeId 900000 / kPassSceneNodeId / kPassOutputLinkId / kPinInBase / kPinOutBase` (Documents/ShaderEditorDocument.cpp:297-303), `kGraphPinIdBase 1<<32` (Panels/AssetGraphPanel.cpp:650), `TextKey <<56` (Documents/ShaderEditorDocument.hpp:1203).
  - Sentinels: `kUnreachableStateId` (Scene/SceneSession.hpp:76).
  - Fixed preview GUIDs: Documents/MaterialSpherePreview.hpp:29, Documents/MeshDocument.cpp:51.
  - Window-id contracts: `kAssetsInstanceId 1` (Panels/InspectorHost.hpp:56), `"###Inspector"` (Panels/InspectorWindows.hpp:26).
- **Enum and array arity**
  - Kind and choice counts: `kAssetKindCount 13` (Panels/AssetPanelModel.hpp:77), `kCreateAssetKindCount 7` (Panels/CreateAssetDialog.hpp:65), `kPrimitiveMeshSourceCount 5` / `kMaterialSurfaceCount 3` (Panels/CreateAssetDialog.hpp:200, :248), `kSystemPhaseChoiceCount` / `kSystemRoleChoiceCount` (Project/ClassTemplates.hpp:36-37).
  - Fixed shapes: the 4-segment selection key (Documents/InputSelectionKey.hpp:40), the 3 grid levels (Viewport/ViewportGrid.hpp:87), and `kInspectorKinds` (Panels/InspectorKinds.hpp:29).
- **Test, automation and frame-protocol values**
  - `m_scriptedOpenFocusFrames 3` (App/EditorApp.cpp:1272).
  - The input probe offsets of 40 px (Documents/InputActionsDocumentWidgets.cpp:306, :445).
  - `m_graphExit` codes (App/EditorApp.cpp:3034, :3067; App/EditorAppFrame.cpp:272).
  - The PropertyGrid hold of 3 frames (Widgets/PropertyGrid.cpp:96) and the zero-dt fallback of 1/60 s (Documents/InputActionsDocument.cpp:231).
- **Cross-process contracts**
  - The Hub cover: 512 px (App/EditorApp.cpp:1962) and the 2 MiB cap (ArcaneHub/src-tauri/src/resolve.rs:109).
  - The recents.archub path and schema (Project/RecentProjects.hpp:9-17).
  - `kDiscoveryExtensions` (Project/ContentDiscovery.hpp:64) must match the cook pipeline.
- **Values whose change would be a bug**
  - `Theme::kNone` (Widgets/EditorTheme.hpp:163).
  - The dock split clamp 0.05..0.95 (Panels/EditorPanels.cpp:533).
  - The permanent Viewport panel (Panels/PanelRegistry.hpp:54).
  - The dockspace host's zero style (Panels/EditorPanels.cpp:154-156).

### Notes

- **Shortcut counts differ from the spec.** The spec says "~40 checks in 8 files". The code has about 49 ImGui-routed key checks across 11 files:
  - EditorAppFrame, InputActionsDocument, InputActionsDocumentWidgets, MeshDocument, ShaderEditorDocument, SpriteDocument, AssetBrowserPanel, AssetGraphPanel, EditorPanels, InspectorWindows, PropertyGrid.
  - Plus 22 raw-scancode bindings in `EditorAppFrame.cpp` and 7 key paths inside the vendored imgui-node-editor.
- **There are two input routes.** Global, viewport and camera keys read SDL **scancodes** through `InputSnapshot` (App/EditorAppFrame.cpp:895-1204). Everything else reads ImGui keys. The action registry (s7.2) must resolve chords for both.
  - Scancodes are physical positions: on AZERTY, "W" is the key labelled Z. Decide whether `editor.keys.*` stores scancodes or ImGui keys.
- **Node-editor keys live in ThirdParty** (imgui_node_editor.cpp:3371, :4437-4445, :4999). Rebinding them needs a local fix or a disable-shortcuts hook (`ed::EnableShortcuts`) plus our own handling.
  - Space raises a `CreateNode` candidate that the editor never accepts. It is a dead key today.
- **The menus already drift from the code:**
  - Edit > Redo prints only "Ctrl+Y" (Panels/EditorPanels.cpp:275), but Ctrl+Shift+Z also redoes.
  - Edit > Rename/Delete print F2/Del (:302, :304), but those keys only fire while the Outliner has focus.
  - Edit > Select All has no chord, while the Console uses Ctrl+A.
  - The spec's "menus show the current chord" rule fixes all of this.
- **Hard pixel sizes ignore font size and scale.** About 60 sizes, paddings and font-px constants (12/13/14/24 px fonts, 24 px rows, dialog widths) are absolute. `editor.ui.scale` (s7.3) will not reach them unless they become DERIVED from `fontSize × ratio` or `scale × base`. I marked the font sizes DERIVED and the paddings SETTING Dev. Consider one `editor.ui.scale` multiplier rather than about 100 individual Dev cvars.
- **Colours drift from the theme tokens:**
  - Panels/EditorPanels.cpp:1348 uses (1.0, 0.45, 0.45) for errors, not `Theme::kError`.
  - :1243 uses 0.80 gray, not `Theme::kText`.
  - The mesh preview light direction (Documents/MeshDocument.cpp:423) differs from the material preview and harvester's (0.45, 0.7, 0.8).
  - The camera speed clamp is spelled twice (Viewport/EditorCamera.cpp:114 and Viewport/ViewportSettings.hpp:66-67).
- **Fallback shadow copies.** Every existing editor cvar re-spells its default as a `ReadInt`/`ReadFloat` fallback and does a string `Find` on every read. Both break s10.2: no shadow copies, and reads come from snapshots.
- **Graph canvases cannot apply style live.** `ApplyGraphCanvasStyle` and `ApplyZoomLevels` latch at `ed::CreateEditor`, so "Restart" here means "reopen the document". A binding could re-apply `ed::GetStyle()` when the snapshot changes to make these Live.
- **Gizmo snap is outside this scope but editor-facing.** Its defaults live in ArcaneClient (Gizmo.hpp:94-97). The editor default-constructs `GizmoSnap` and only sets `enabled` from Ctrl. There is no snap UI.
- **Gaps found:**
  - There is no unfocused/background frame throttle (only a 1 ms minimized sleep). Candidate: `editor.perf.backgroundFps`.
  - There is no `ScaleAllSizes` or DPI handling.
- **ImGui io/style defaults the editor never sets** are natural Preferences candidates (proposed `editor.ui.input.*`, Pref-M, Live):
  - `MouseDoubleClickTime` (used by the slow-click rename) and `HoverStationaryDelay` (used at Panels/AssetGraphPanel.cpp:2394).
  - `KeyRepeatDelay`, `KeyRepeatRate`, `MouseDragThreshold`.
  - `IniSavingRate` (layout autosave cadence).
- **Out of scope but noted:**
  - The 2D ortho near/far ±1000 lives in ArcaneClient's `ViewTransform`.
  - `kSettleIntervalMs` / `kHangMainSeconds` are HostConfig automation values.
- **New-asset template content** (the default node positions and colour at App/EditorAppProject.cpp:1708-1716 and Documents/ShaderEditorDocument.cpp:3999-4011) is better moved to shipped template assets than to cvars.
- **The Hub cannot join the cvar registry** (Rust/Tauri, separate process). Its `settings.archub` and `theme.css` stay its own stores. If Preferences should surface them, it needs a JSON bridge.
- **The comment at Panels/AssetReferenceField.cpp:22** ("a size, not a tunable") conflicts with s10.1's rule. I classified it SETTING Dev and flagged it for the allow-list review.
- **Totals:**
  - Theme: 31 tokens (27 SETTING, 3 DERIVED aliases, 1 CONSTANT), plus about 27 domain-palette and alpha rows.
  - Style metrics: 5.
  - Stores: 4 ImGui ini sections, plus user cvar archive, recents, scene recents, texture `.meta`, Hub settings, and caches.
  - Existing cvars: 16, of which 10 are editor-declared.
