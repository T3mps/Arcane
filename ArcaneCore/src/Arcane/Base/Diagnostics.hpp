// Engine diagnostics (Base module): the post-mortem capture seam, sibling to
// Log.hpp and Assert.hpp. Two triggers, ONE report path:
//
//   1. CRASH -- SetUnhandledExceptionFilter. An access violation or an escaped
//      C++ exception writes a report instead of dying mute.
//   2. HANG  -- a watchdog thread. The main thread publishes a Heartbeat(); if
//      it stops advancing for longer than Config::hangSeconds, the watchdog
//      writes the SAME report for a process that is still very much alive.
//
// (2) is the reason this module exists. Windows Error Reporting's LocalDumps
// covers (1) already and is a fine backstop, but WER only ever fires on process
// DEATH -- a wedged main thread ("Not Responding") produces nothing, anywhere,
// forever. Neither does a debugger help much when the defect is intermittent:
// it requires a human attached at the exact moment. The watchdog does not.
//
// A report is written on a DEDICATED CRASH THREAD (crash window plan 1, task
// 5; spec S5.2), never on the thread that faulted -- that thread only freezes
// the log backlog, hands over the fault context, waits, and exits. The steps
// run in UE's order, each independently survivable:
//
//   1. the watchdog is paused so no hang report interleaves;
//   2. the portable stack of the WALKED thread (RtlVirtualUnwind against
//      ModuleTable -- no DbgHelp, no loader lock, so no symbol load can wedge
//      a process that is already misbehaving);
//   3. a MINIMAL .arcdiag envelope, so a reporter can start even if
//      everything after this step wedges;
//   4. the MINIDUMP (.dmp) -- the artifact a debugger opens;
//   5. the TEXT report (.txt): header + `module + 0xoffset` frames. It is no
//      longer symbolized and no longer covers every thread: both were the
//      in-process freeze this arc exists to remove, and the reporter
//      reconstructs them out of process from the minidump;
//   6. the GPU-section provider (DRED, device fault), unchanged;
//   7. the FULL envelope, rewritten atomically over the minimal one;
//   8. the log backlog as `<stem>.log.txt`, a bounded file-sink flush, and
//      the reporter hand-off.
//
// NOTHING on that path may touch the heap (the heap may be what just faulted):
// the arena (Base/CrashArena.hpp) is the only allocator, the envelope JSON is
// hand-written through it, and every string the report needs is snapshotted
// into fixed storage OFF the crash path (at Install/RetargetDumpDir). The two
// documented exceptions both run only after files are already on disk: the
// GPU-section provider, and the ARC_ERROR echo + report-written hook.
//
// Reading it needs no debugger, which is the whole point -- the text file is
// the artifact you paste into a bug report.
//
// Windows-only today; every entry point compiles and no-ops elsewhere so the
// planned Linux port keeps linking.

// rows are never added or removed, so there is no reconciliation to get wrong.
