// Engine logger (Base module): console-sink spdlog logger named "Arcane".
// Deliberately separate from Core's Logger (Util/Logger.hpp), which serves
// engine-agnostic named-category logging for library code; this is the
// engine runtime's own console logger. File sinks and per-module categories
// can grow here when the engine needs them.
// spdlog is header-only in this workspace: each module has its OWN spdlog
// registry. Consumers must reach this logger via Engine() / the ARC_*
// macros -- spdlog::get("Arcane") in another module returns null.

    // never happens on the crash path -- it happens during normal startup,
    // long before any crash) lazily starts one dedicated helper thread that
    // parks on a condition variable, waiting to be asked to flush. Calling
    // FlushFileSinkBounded computes a single deadline (now + timeoutMs) that
    // covers the WHOLE call: it takes the shared mutex with a bounded
    // try_lock_until (never an unbounded lock -- review fix round 1, finding
    // 3: even acquiring that mutex must not be able to block forever), then
    // signals the helper and waits on a SEPARATE completion condition

    // acquiring the mutex, or the helper itself being stuck on a mutex the
    // dying faulting thread held (in that case the helper thread leaks, but
    // the process is already on its way down). Returns false immediately,
    // with no wait, if no helper thread was ever started (AttachFileSink
    // never succeeded) or no file sink is attached. The caller-side
    // wait/signal uses only pre-constructed synchronization primitives and
    // never allocates. Log::Shutdown() stops and joins the helper thread;
