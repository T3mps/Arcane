    // N RUNTIMES, ONE MODULE IMAGE (Core-DLL split, spec docs/specs/2026-09-15-core-
    // dll-split-design.md s4/s5, plan 1 P9): a host attaches every world this module
    // serves. The FIRST attached is the PRIMARY -- the world handed to the module as
    // EngineContext::engine, the one whose SaveState/LoadState carries state across a
    // hot reload; every other attached Runtime is snapshot/restored through its
    // registry alone and repopulated from the module's re-registered system factories.
    //
    // WHAT THE N WORLDS SHARE, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT:
    //   * ONE ComponentRegistry -- the PRIMARY's. Component types are registered ONCE
    //     per DLL load (spec R1), and a module opens its Astra::ComponentModule on the
    //     primary's registry alone (GameModule.hpp) -- so a secondary MUST be built as
    //     Runtime(process, mode, primary.Components()), and AttachRuntime REFUSES one
    //     that is not. Otherwise the module's component types resolve in the primary
    //     world and nowhere else, and a registry snapshot moved between the two worlds
    //     fails with UnknownComponent.
    //   * SYSTEMS are PER-WORLD: one factory table, and each world's own NetMode
    //     decides what it instantiates (Arcane/Plugin/SystemFactory.hpp).
    //   * REGISTRY DATA is PER-WORLD: its own entities and resources, its own
    //     snapshot/restore across a hot reload.
    //

    // dtor calls into them); DetachRuntime is the seam for a world that dies first.
