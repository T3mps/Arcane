// RuntimeFrame: RuntimeApp::MainLoop's frame BODY, as free functions.
//
// MainLoop keeps: the pre-loop setup (locals, the render-half boot + window
// reveal), the while/if-else SKELETON that calls the functions below in
// order, and the post-loop ShutdownGraphPath() call. Everything else lives
// here.
//
// THE SHAPE, so a reader can see it rather than reconstruct it:
//   * ONE WINDOW IS PUMPED, always the host's. Windowed, the render half
//     borrows this exact window and presents into it; under --headless the
//     window exists but is never shown, and the pump keeps running because
//     ImGui and the input stack are wired to it either way.
//   * ONE RESIZE, `io.graph->Resize`, to that window's one presentation
//     surface and to nothing else -- and only in HOST-WINDOW MODE, because
//     that is the only mode with a surface to resize. See PumpAndResize.
//   * BuildHud IS ONLY THE HUD: the ImGui frame, the "ArcaneRuntime" window
//     and DrawUIAll. PrepareFrame, called straight after it, is the scene
//     resolver's Refresh.
//   * THE FRAME'S EXTENT comes from the vehicle's own surface -- the
//     swapchain's, or the offscreen output's, read mode-agnostically through
//     SurfaceWidth/SurfaceHeight (see FrameExtent in the .cpp). There is no
//     second surface that could disagree with it in either mode.
//   * ImGui CALLS GO THROUGH ImGuiLayer (RenderToDrawData / EndFrameDiscard)
//     instead of bare ImGui::Render()/EndFrame(), so the context pin the
//     layer owns covers them too.
//
// RenderGraph is the only per-frame render function here: the frame graph is
// the only render path. It is the ONE function that still names the mode, at
// exactly one line -- the vehicle's RenderFrame/RenderFrameOffscreen pair
// refuses each other's mode by design, so the frame driver has to pick.
