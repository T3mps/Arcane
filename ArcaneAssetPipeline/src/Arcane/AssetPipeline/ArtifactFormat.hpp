// Arcane::AssetPipeline::ArtifactFormat -- the ".arcart" artifact container: a small,
// stable-on-disk binary format the offline cook (arccook, later tasks) writes and the runtime
// content loader reads. Two artifact kinds share this one container, discriminated via
// ContentKind: Texture (WriteTextureArtifact/ReadTextureArtifact) and, as of F2c, Mesh
// (WriteMeshArtifact/ReadMeshArtifact). Fixed little-endian header + a tagged section table
// (MipTable/Payload/Thumbnail for Texture; VertexData/IndexData/SectionTable/Tangents for
// Mesh -- SectionTag values 1-7 all live in ONE shared space) so each kind's reader SKIPS a
// section tag it does not recognise -- including a tag that belongs to the OTHER kind --
// rather than failing on it (forward-compat).
//
// Every multi-byte field is written EXPLICITLY, one byte at a time, little-endian -- never a
// raw struct memcpy. Struct padding is compiler/ABI dependent; a memcpy'd struct would make the
// artifact non-deterministic across toolchains/configs, which breaks content-hash-based caching
// in later tasks (spec s4).
//
// BYTE-CONTRACT PEER (F2b Task 6): ArcaneClient/src/Arcane/Assets/ArtifactReader.hpp/.cpp
// mirrors BOTH pairs by hand -- a DELIBERATE, INDEPENDENT reimplementation, not a shared
// consumer of this header (ArcaneClient must never link/include ArcaneAssetPipeline). It
// currently mirrors only the texture pair; F2c Task 4 lands the mesh half. The two sides stay
// byte-compatible ONLY by both following this written contract by hand; a layout change to
// EITHER pair must be mirrored there, or ArtifactReaderTest.cpp's cross-lib round-trip case
// (fixtures written through THIS file's writers, read back through that file's readers) fails
// loudly.
