// Arcane::AssetPipeline::CookSession -- F2b Task 5: the shared cook orchestration both
// arccook (this task's CLI, arccook/src/main.cpp) and the editor's in-process cook
// (Task 12) drive VERBATIM, so the CLI and the editor never diverge on what "stale" or
// "cooked" means. A CookSession owns no state across calls beyond the last CookProject
// call's failure map -- every CookProject/CheckProject call opens its own
// Arcane::AssetPipeline::ArtifactStore rooted at <projectDir>/Intermediate and reads the
// project's Content/ tree fresh, so a session is cheap to construct once per process
// (arccook's main.cpp) or reuse across many calls (a future editor cook button).
//
// F2c Task 8 (spec s5.1, R6): generalized the spine to cover TWO cookable kinds --
// Texture and, as of this task, Mesh -- over the CookKinds() table below. R6's recorded
// fallback (generalize only the store/index, keep sessions separate) is NOT taken here,
// and the reason is worth stating: the kind table carries DATA (extensions, meta-block
// key) while the per-kind work stays in per-kind private members/dispatch. Iterating a
// data table and dispatching on a small closed enum IS the generalized spine;
// type-erasing four differently-typed operations behind one std::function is the
// "awkward signatures" outcome the fallback was recorded against, wearing the same name.
// Texture behavior is BYTE-IDENTICAL across this widening -- every texture-facing type,
// string, and file layout is untouched; only the source enumeration/settings-read/cook-
// key/importer/writer calls are now reached through the kind table instead of being
// hardcoded to the texture path.
//
// Source enumeration: every source extension in the kind table (CookKinds() below --
// ".png" for Texture, ".gltf"/".glb" for Mesh) found under <projectDir>/Content
// (recursive) that has a sibling "<file>.meta" sidecar (Unity convention -- matches
// ArcaneClient/src/Arcane/Project/AssetRegistry.cpp's ResolveSidecarId) is a cookable
// source. A source with no sidecar is not yet a registered asset -- CookSession never
// mints one (minting a guid is AssetRegistry's job, host-side only) -- it is silently
// skipped, never a failure. Nothing outside Content/ is ever considered: in particular
// ReferenceProject/Verify/References/*.png (the golden-image ORACLE) is never under
// Content/ and must never cook.
//
// Staleness: a source is up to date iff an artifact already exists at
// ArtifactStore::PathFor(<the source's kind-appropriate cook key over its CURRENT bytes
// and settings> -- ComputeCookKey for Texture, ComputeMeshCookKey for Mesh) -- a PURE,
// content-addressed check that needs no in-memory index and is correct even the very
// first time this process has ever seen the project. CheckProject uses exactly this
// check, and nothing else, to answer `anyStale`.
//
// Failure memoization: when a source's importer refuses it (TextureImporter::
// ImportTexture returning nullopt for corrupt/unrecognised bytes; MeshImporter::
// ImportMesh returning a non-empty MeshImportResult::refusal) for a given cook key, the
// reason is persisted to <projectDir>/Intermediate/Failed/<hex16>.fail (same hash-keyed
// spirit as ArtifactStore, deliberately simpler -- one flat file per key, no 256-way
// sharding, because failures are rare relative to artifacts). A later CookProject call
// -- same OR a different CookSession/process, sharing the same Intermediate/ tree -- for
// the SAME cook key reads that memo and reports the failure again WITHOUT ever
// re-invoking the importer: the "no retry storm" contract, kind-agnostic by construction
// because the memo read/write path is SHARED spine code, never duplicated per kind. The
// memo is itself keyed by the cook key (source bytes + settings + importer version), so
// it self-invalidates the moment any of those three change -- a fixed/edited source or a
// settings change computes a NEW cook key with no memo, and is attempted again.
// ArtifactStore::Commit failures (rare IO errors, not the source's fault) are
// deliberately NOT memoized -- they are retried every call, since the cost of retrying a
// commit is one file write, not a decode+encode. A mesh source whose external buffer
// (spec s5.4) cannot be read is likewise never memoized -- there is no stable cook key
// to memo it under yet (the key itself depends on the buffer's bytes) -- it is reported
// as a failure and simply retried next call, the same "cheap to retry" reasoning Commit
// failures get.
