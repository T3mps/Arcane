// ===== THE EDITOR'S FULL PROCESS EXIT-CODE TABLE ============================
// Gathered in ONE place. This function's own `return rc;` at the bottom is the
// single point every path below drains through, which is what makes this
// comment honestly exhaustive rather than a claim about code scattered across
// three files.
//
//   0  -- clean exit (including a user quit / closed splash mid-boot).
//   1  -- a boot/init failure (EditorApp::InitResult::Failed), OR a graph
//         frame FAILED, OR GPU device loss. The NRI frame graph is the only
//         render path, so the graph-frame case can fire on ANY run.
//   2  -- PRE-BOOT, from THIS function: no project and no plugin with
//         --frames (a scripted run with nothing to open and nobody to
//         answer a dialog). Also HostConfig::Parse's own refusals (a bad
//         flag, a bad option value) -- those return before main() even
//         reaches this point.
//   2  -- RenderErrorCount GREW across the run, teardown included. Like
//         code 1 it is ungated, so it can fire on any run.
//   3  -- PRE-BOOT, from THIS function: this project is already open in
//         another live editor (the direct-launch double-open guard below;
//         the rival is focused before returning).
//   3  -- (Task 9) --settle N never converged (two consecutive captures
//         never compared byte-equal with the compiler idle before the bail
//         CONJUNCTION fired: BOTH the attempt budget AND --settle-timeout
//         spent, never either alone -- Arcane/Host/SettleBound.hpp) --
//         exitReason "settle-not-converged" or "compare-failed" in the JSON
//         report. Same code RuntimeApp uses for the identical fact
//         (RuntimeApp.cpp's ShutdownGraphPath) -- see the collision note
//         below for why this reuses 3 rather than claiming a fresh number.
//         NOTE FOR ARGUMENT DECODERS (ArcaneHub launch.rs golden_run): this
//         line is the evidence that --compare is NOT the only route to a
//         post-boot 3. A --settle run with no --compare anywhere reaches
//         this arm, so a predicate keying on --compare alone under-detects.
//   4  -- (Task 9) --compare named a reference that does not exist on disk
//         (or exists but failed to decode) and --bless was not given --
//         exitReason "compare-missing-reference", zero frames rendered
//         (EditorApp::MainLoop's pre-loop resolve-and-fail-fast, mirroring
//         RuntimeApp::MainLoop's own). ALSO --bless converged but failed to
//         WRITE the reference -- exitReason "compare-failed" then. Same
//         code RuntimeApp uses for both facts.
//
// THE COLLISIONS, named rather than left for a reader to rediscover:
//
// Exit code 2 means TWO DIFFERENT THINGS depending on WHEN in the run it
// fires, and ArcaneHub's launch.rs decoder (BOOT_WATCHDOG, 2 seconds) reads
// whichever one arrives inside that window. A run that reaches
// EditorApp::Run() at all has already cleared the pre-boot refusals THIS
// function performs, so from there on a 2 means the later thing above -- but
// the Hub cannot tell the difference from the outside, and would misreport a
// fast one.
//
// NO GUARD CAN CLOSE IT, and launch.rs does not pretend otherwise. The NRI
// frame graph is the only render path, unconditionally, so code 2 can fire on
// ANY ordinary Hub launch that exits inside the 2s watchdog with a validation
// error, and an ordinary launch carries none of the tokens a heuristic could
// key on. So launch.rs's code-2 arm names BOTH meanings -- project gate or
// render error -- rather than confidently reporting an engine/abi refusal that
// was never involved.
//
// Exit code 3 gained a SECOND meaning with Task 9, for the same reason code 2
// already has two: matching RuntimeApp's own m_graphExit numbering (3 =
// settle-not-converged, 4 = compare-missing-reference/bless-write-failed) so
// the two hosts' internal fold logic stays one vocabulary, rather than
// minting editor-only numbers RuntimeApp does not share, outweighs avoiding a
// reuse of 3 the double-open guard already claimed. A HUMAN running one
// deliberate command line knows which precondition applied and is never
// actually confused -- the pre-boot double-open guard fires before any engine
// boot at all, with no project ever opened and no report ever written (it is
// no longer ahead of Diagnostics::Install, which task 9 moved to the top of
// main, but Install only ARMS the report path -- a plain refusal still writes
// nothing), while the post-boot settle-not-converged/compare-failed code
// requires a full boot and a --headless --settle run.
//
// A SCRIPTED CALLER LOOPING COMMAND-LINE COMBINATIONS CANNOT ASSUME THAT,
// though (Task 12's golden-gate harness is exactly this caller: it cannot
// know from outside whether a stale editor process is holding a project
// lock in CI) -- so the disambiguator has to be a FACT ON DISK, not an
// assumption about which command was run:
//
//     THE DISAMBIGUATOR IS REPORT-FILE EXISTENCE. A pre-boot double-open
//     refusal never reaches EditorApp::Run() -- let alone MainLoop -- so it
//     writes NO report at all, regardless of whether --report was passed.
//     A post-boot settle-not-converged/compare-failed exit, by construction,
//     only ever happens on a run that got as far as ShutdownGraphPath's
//     report block, which ALWAYS writes to --report's path when that flag
//     was given (see that function -- the write is unconditional on reaching
//     the block, independent of whether the run converged). So: exit 3 with
//     --report on the command line and the named file MISSING means the
//     pre-boot refusal; exit 3 with the file PRESENT (and its exitReason
//     naming one of the two post-boot facts) means the settle/compare one.
//
// THIS IS ALSO THE GENERAL RULE, not a special case invented for this one
// collision: RuntimeApp already collapses two distinct facts onto its own
// exit 3 (a non-converged settle vs. a converged-but-mismatched --compare)
// and two onto its own exit 4 (a missing/undecodable reference vs. a bless
// that converged but failed to write) -- see this file's own table above.
// A caller that wants to know WHAT HAPPENED, on either host, should always
// read `exitReason` out of the JSON report rather than trust the raw
// process exit code alone; report-file existence is simply that same rule
// extended one step further back, to cover the one exit-3 case where the
// JSON that would explain it might not exist yet.
//
// ===== WHICH SHARED HostConfig FLAGS THIS HOST ACTUALLY HONOURS ==============
// The table above is exhaustive about EXIT CODES; this is the separate,
// easily-confused question of FLAGS, and it is called out because HostConfig
// is shared by both hosts, so a flag the editor parses is not automatically a
// flag the editor DOES anything with.
//   --project/--plugin/--frames/--backend/--no-vsync -- honoured.
//   --screenshot        -- honoured. WINDOWED it captures the VIEWPORT panel's
//                          texture, not the editor window (so the Inspector and
//                          the asset browser are not in it). Under --headless
//                          it captures the COMPOSITED EDITOR FRAME instead --
//                          chrome, docking, panels, and the viewport texture
//                          inside its panel -- off the offscreen chrome
//                          context's colour target (EditorAppFrame.cpp's
//                          PresentChromeFrame).
//   --headless          -- honoured. No window is ever mapped and no swapchain
//                          is built anywhere: the chrome context becomes an
//                          OffscreenVehicle (EditorApp::CreateGraphVehicles),
//                          the boot splash below is not constructed at all, and
//                          the per-project ImGui layout is PINNED to the
//                          committed <project>/Saved/verify-layout.ini seed with
//                          io.IniFilename null, so a run can neither read a
//                          machine-local layout nor write one back.
//                          Requires --frames N (HostConfig refuses otherwise).
//   --dump-layout <path> -- HONOURED as of Task 10 (plan-b comparator): write
//                          the LIVE ImGui layout to <path> at shutdown
//                          (EditorApp::Shutdown, unconditionally on
//                          --headless -- ImGui::SaveIniSettingsToDisk never
//                          consults io.IniFilename, so it writes to the given
//                          path even though that pointer is null offscreen).
//                          This is the authoring half of the committed
//                          ReferenceProject/Saved/verify-layout.ini seed:
//                          `--project ReferenceProject --headless --frames N
//                          --dump-layout out.ini` produces a file with REAL
//                          EditorDockHost dock-node ids, no windowed session
//                          required. THE ONE FLAG THIS HOST HONOURS THAT
//                          ArcaneRuntime REFUSES OUTRIGHT (see that exe's
//                          main.cpp) -- there is no ImGui layout on a game
//                          host to dump.
//   --play-as <topology> -- HONOURED as of the Core-DLL split's plan 1 Task 7:
//                          enter Play at the END of boot (EditorApp::
//                          StageFinalize, after the boot scene is loaded) in the
//                          named topology -- standalone | listen-server |
//                          embedded-server | client, the scripted half of the
//                          transport's play-mode picker. THE SECOND FLAG THIS
//                          HOST HONOURS THAT ArcaneRuntime REFUSES OUTRIGHT (see
//                          that exe's main.cpp, beside --dump-layout's refusal):
//                          a game host has no Edit mode to leave and no play
//                          session to enter.
//   --select-name <n>   -- HONOURED: select the entity with that Identity.name
//                          at the end of boot and frame it. Missing name is a
//                          loud error, not a silent skip.
//   --tool <tool>       -- HONOURED: viewport tool at boot (select | move |
//                          rotate | scale). Pairs with --select-name for a
//                          scripted gizmo capture. THE FOURTH/FIFTH FLAGS
//                          THIS HOST HONOURS THAT ArcaneRuntime REFUSES.
//   --view-mode <mode>  -- HONOURED as of F4 plan 1 T7: seed the editor
//                          viewport camera's mode (2d | perspective) at the end
//                          of boot, AFTER the persisted [EditorViewport][Camera]
//                          block has been read, so the flag beats the desk's
//                          persisted mode (EditorApp::StageFinalize + the
//                          settings handler's ReadLine). Absent = the persisted
//                          mode, or the 2D default (the headless verify layout
//                          carries no such block, so goldens run in 2D). THE
//                          THIRD FLAG THIS HOST HONOURS THAT ArcaneRuntime
//                          REFUSES OUTRIGHT: a game host has no editor camera.
//   --settle / --report -- HONOURED as of Task 9 (the editor's verification
//   --compare / --bless    surface): PresentChromeFrame's capture arm is the
//                          SAME three-conjunct predicate (byte-equal &&
//                          shader-compiler-idle && [reference-match])
//                          RuntimeFrame::CaptureTail uses, ported rather than
//                          reinvented, and ShutdownGraphPath writes the same
//                          VerifyReport schema (schemaVersion 3) the runtime
//                          does -- settle facts included, and reconciled with
//                          the runtime's in the same commit that added them,
//                          so `settleAttemptsUsed` means the same thing on
//                          both hosts. See both functions' own comments. The
//                          one divergence from the runtime is structural, not
//                          a gap: this host implements no --probe (below), so
//                          the report's `probes` array is always empty and
//                          there is no `pick` field -- `census` is unaffected,
//                          being carried unconditionally on both hosts.
//   --probe             -- REFUSED at launch on this host, loudly (see below
//                          main()). A scripted caller asking for a pixel/pick
//                          probe would otherwise get exit 0 and a report with
//                          no matching entry -- the same silent-success shape
//                          Task 8 found on the runtime (a --report with pixel
//                          probes and no --screenshot ran, exited 0, and
//                          reported "no capture set" for every probe).
//                          Parsing it and shrugging would be worse than
//                          refusing. ArcaneRuntime honours it.
//   --scene              -- REFUSED at launch on this host (final-fix-wave
//                          audit; this table used to claim it was honoured,
//                          which was FALSE -- HostConfig::sceneOverride has
//                          no consumer anywhere in ArcaneEditor/. The only
//                          hit in this tree is a passing comment in
//                          Project/RuntimeLaunch.hpp; the sole real consumer
//                          is ArcaneRuntime's RuntimeApp.cpp. Without this
//                          refusal, `ArcaneEditor --scene <guid>` parsed,
//                          booted the manifest's default scene, and exited
//                          0 -- silent success for a caller that asked for a
//                          SPECIFIC scene.
//   --fixed-dt           -- REFUSED at launch on this host (final-fix-wave
//                          audit; previously not even mentioned in this
//                          table). The sim clock (EditorAppFrame.cpp's
//                          AdvanceSim) and the chrome/plugin-input clock
//                          (EditorAppFrame.cpp:492-495) are each an
//                          INDEPENDENT std::chrono::steady_clock read --
//                          neither ever looks at fixedDtSeconds. Refusal is
//                          keyed on fixedDtSupplied (HostConfig.hpp), not the
//                          resolved value: the registered default (1/60) is
//                          itself a value a caller could legitimately pass on
//                          purpose, so comparing the resolved double against
//                          that default cannot tell "never passed" from
//                          "passed the default explicitly" apart -- same
//                          r.Supplied() reasoning HostConfig.cpp already uses
//                          for this exact flag internally.
//   --nri-graph         -- PARSED AND IGNORED: the NRI frame graph is the only
//                          render path, so there is nothing left for this flag
//                          to select. THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to rule 3
//                          (Task 12 audit) rather than a drift nobody caught:
//                          refusing it would break saved Hub launch args and
//                          scripts that still pass it out of habit, for a flag
//                          that costs nothing to leave parsed-and-ignored. See
//                          HostConfig.cpp's own carve-out comment. Do not
//                          "fix" this one into a refusal.

//                          the refusal below main()). Re-derived rather than
//                          trusted: this comment used to call it a plain
//                          no-op, which undersold it. It IS a no-op from the
//                          caller's side -- nothing ever reports a hit/miss --
//                          but it is not a zero-cost one on a WINDOWED editor.
//                          NriGraphContext.cpp:524's
//                          `m_pickArmed = config.pickProbe && !IsOffscreen()`
//                          reads false only for the OFFSCREEN VIEWPORT
//                          context; the CHROME (host-window) context this
//                          editor also owns is NOT offscreen when windowed, so
//                          the flag DOES arm there -- the pick + JFA outline
//                          NODES get built and one ARC_INFO line gets logged.
//                          What still never happens is the per-frame PASS:
//                          EditorAppFrame.cpp's chrome FrameDesc never sets
//                          `pickOutline`, so AddPickNodes never runs, nothing
//                          is drawn, and no id is ever read back. Net effect
//                          for a caller is unchanged (still nothing useful),
//                          which is why refusing outright is still correct --
//                          it is also a RUNTIME desk item: one fixed canvas
//                          pixel reported as an exit code, and the editor's
