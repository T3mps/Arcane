// CookQueue -- F2b Task 12: the editor's background texture cook, watcher-
// triggered, hash-decided, never blocks. Pure logic, no ImGui and no
// EditorApp dependency (same "[editor]-unit-testable headlessly" pattern as
// ModuleBuild.hpp's composition half): a watcher (EditorAppProject.cpp's
// PollAssetWatch, ~1 Hz mtime sweep) calls NoteChanged() whenever a texture
// source or its .meta sidecar changed on disk; this class owns the
// hash-gate-and-coalesce decision of WHEN to actually run
// Arcane::AssetPipeline::CookSession::CookProject, submits that run through
// an injected Submit function (JobSystem::Submit in production, so a cook
// never runs on -- or blocks -- the caller), and hands finished results back
// to Pump(), called once per frame on the SAME thread NoteChanged() is
// called from.
//
// THREADING CONTRACT: NoteChanged()/CookPending()/Pump() are all meant to be
// called from ONE thread (the editor's main thread in production). The
// CookSession this class owns is touched ONLY from inside a Submit()'d job
// (a JobSystem worker thread) -- m_running is the mutual-exclusion flag that
// guarantees at most one such job is ever mid-CookProject at a time, so two
// job invocations can never touch the SAME CookSession concurrently. The
// completion callback installed via SetOnCookComplete runs ONLY from inside
// Pump(), i.e. on the calling thread, never on the worker -- so it is safe
// for that callback to touch GPU-adjacent state (NriTextureCache, the
// Assets facade, Diagnostics::Publish) the way a worker thread must not.
//
// COALESCING, not per-change queuing: a burst of N NoteChanged() calls while
// a cook is already running collapses into at most ONE follow-up
// CookProject pass (not N), because CookProject re-scans the whole project
// and is itself hash-gated -- nothing is lost by folding several change
// notifications into one pass that runs after all of them landed.
