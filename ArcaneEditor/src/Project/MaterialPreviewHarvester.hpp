// MaterialPreviewHarvester (asset-manager redesign, Plan 1 Task 8; widened F2c Plan 2
// Task 9): LIVE 64px thumbnails of real .arcmat MATERIALS and, from F2c, real .arcmesh
// MESH ASSETS, for the Assets panel -- real shaded pixels of the actual asset, not a
// kind icon. The class name stays (renaming it would touch every call site for no
// behavioural gain); its charter is what widened.
//
// ===== THE SHAPE, IN ONE PARAGRAPH ==================================
// One LAZY 64x64 offscreen NriGraphContext (the same vehicle
// ShaderEditorDocument::EnsureGraphPreviewContext builds for its own preview,
// at 64 instead of 512), one device-less Batcher2D, and ONE SHARED LIFO queue
// of {Guid, Subject} work items -- a material or a mesh asset, never two
// separate queues (a burst of one subject must not starve the other). Pump()
// takes AT MOST ONE item per call, renders the shader editor's
// quad-on-checkerboard (or a lit sphere, for a mesh-kind material), or --
// for a mesh ASSET -- the mesh's own geometry framed by its AABB
// (MeshImportWave.hpp's FrameMeshBounds), captures it with ReadCapture, hands
// the tight RGBA to the CHROME context's NriTextureCache under a synthetic
// per-asset Guid, and writes the same bytes to
// <project>/Saved/Thumbnails/<guid>.png. The panel then draws
// ThumbTextureId(id) like any other ImGui image.
//
// A MESH thumbnail compiles NOTHING (a mesh-kind .arcmat has no snippet, and
// the mesh path was already the harvester's one compile-free branch), so it
// needs no new stage-key slot in the process-wide scheme documented below --
// not needing to extend that table is the evidence this belongs in the same
// class rather than a second harvester competing for the same device idle.
//
// ===== WHY ONE PER PUMP, AND WHY THE PUMP MUST EARLY-OUT ============
// ReadCapture idles the whole device (NriGraphContext::ReadCapture's own
// contract; EditorApp::CaptureGraphViewportPng states the same rationale for
// the cover screenshot: "BOTH CALL SITES ARE RARE EVENTS ... which is what
// pays for ReadCapture's DeviceWaitIdle"). A harvester that idled once per
// material per frame would stall the editor for as long as the backlog lasts,
// so: one harvest per frame, and Pump() returns before touching ANY device
// object when the queue is empty. Once the queue drains there is no per-frame
// cost at all -- not a resolve, not a fence wait, not an allocation.
//
// ===== WHY IT IS PERSISTED (the UE lesson) ==========================
// UE stores a rendered FObjectThumbnail in the package header and re-renders
// only on save (EThumbnailRenderFrequency::OnAssetSave) precisely because
// re-rendering every thumbnail at every editor start does not scale. Same
// here: a successful harvest writes <project>/Saved/Thumbnails/<guid>.png, and
// PrimeFromDisk() loads those PNGs straight into the pixel supply at project
// open, queueing a harvest ONLY for a material with no PNG or whose .arcmat is
// NEWER than its PNG. An unchanged project therefore boots with ZERO device
// idles for thumbnails.
//
// ===== THE COMPILE PATH, AND THE ONE RULE IT MUST NOT BREAK =========
// A real material thumbnail needs the material's COMPILED bytes, and this
// class resolves + submits them itself rather than owning a second
// SpriteMaterialCache/PostChainCache. That is not duplication for its own
// sake, it is the only safe shape: ShaderCompiler::Submit COALESCES by
// coalesceKey ("a newer Submit replaces a pending older one, and stale
// in-flight results are dropped at Drain"), so a second instance of either
// cache would submit the SAME key for the same material as the scene's
// instance -- silently cancelling the scene's in-flight compile and stranding
// its pending entry forever. So this class takes its own slot in the
// process-wide stage-key scheme:
//
//     ShaderEditorDocument  0x1 / 0x2      (open document)
//     SpriteMaterialCache   0x4 / 0x8      (scene sprite materials)
//     PostChainCache        0x10 / 0x20    (scene post chain)
//     THIS CLASS            0x40 / 0x80    (material thumbnails)
//
// Results reach it through the process's ONE drain site
// (SceneRenderResolver::Services::consumeFirst, EditorApp::Init) via
// OfferCompileResult, which NEVER reports a result as consumed -- it is a
// passive observer beside the caches, not a competitor for their results.
//
// ===== WHAT EACH SURFACE ACTUALLY RENDERS ===========================
// See Pump()'s implementation comment; the short version is sprite -> the
// material on a quad over the checkerboard, fullscreen -> the material's own
// pass chain over that same checkerboard as kSceneInput (exactly what the
// shader editor's preview does), mesh -> a lit UV sphere in the material's
// resolved baseColor (the mocks' spheres; MeshBuilder::BuildUvSphere and the
// vehicle's always-built MeshNode made the real mesh path trivially reachable,
// so the brief's "same quad" fallback was not needed).
