// MeshDocument: the .arcmesh editor (F2a, Task 9) -- gives the procedural mesh
// asset its own document with a live preview, so a user can author one
// without hand-writing JSON. Two halves, deliberately unequal in weight:
//
//   DATA + UNDO   follows SpriteDocument.{hpp,cpp} almost exactly: a flat
//                 MeshAssetData held by value, dirty tracking, whole-data undo
//                 steps built from an activation-time COPY compared against
//                 the live data (PushDataEdit -- SpriteDocument.cpp:123-134),
//                 and a doc-identity anchor so a step left on the shared
//                 CommandStack after this document closes goes inert instead
//                 of dereferencing a dead `this`.
//   PREVIEW       follows ShaderEditorDocument's offscreen-NriGraphContext
//                 pattern ONLY for that one mechanism (its own small vehicle
//                 over the process's one device, built lazily, retired
//                 through the app's one-frame hand-off) -- NOT its scale,
//                 its multi-panel structure, or its async compile machinery.
//                 A mesh needs none of that: BuildMeshData is synchronous and
//                 pure, so there is no compile step to coalesce and no
//                 in-flight job to route a result back to.
//
// TWO CACHES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS THIS WINDOW'S PREVIEW. The preview
// image reads `m_data` DIRECTLY every rebuild (RebuildPreviewMesh), so there
// is nothing in front of THAT to invalidate: an edit or an undo shows up in
// this window the instant it lands. The SCENE is the other story, and it is
// not this document's preview at all: SceneRenderResolver owns a live
// MeshCache (Host/SceneRenderResolver.cpp) whose published MeshTable both
// hosts sweep every frame through GpuSceneSync (PrepareSceneForRender in
// EditorAppFrame.cpp / RuntimeFrame.cpp), and MeshCache::Request memoises per Guid --
// entries leave only via Invalidate/Clear. So a save or an undo that
// invalidates nothing leaves every MeshRenderer in the open scene drawing the
// PRE-edit geometry until the project is switched.
//
// Hence Services::invalidateMesh, called from BOTH Save() and ApplyMeshData()
// -- the same two sites SpriteDocument calls its own invalidateSprite from
// (SpriteDocument.cpp:119-120, :144-145), for the reason stated there: "an
// undo the user cannot see in the scene is indistinguishable from an undo
// that did not happen."
//
// This block used to argue the opposite -- that the mesh sweep (then
// CollectMeshInstances) had no call site outside tests and no live cache existed. Both were true when
// Task 9 wrote it and Task 10 falsified both; the note stays so the old
// conclusion is not re-derived from the same (now wrong) premise.
//
// IMPORTED MESHES (F2c; final-review fix I4, 2026-09-11): every companion
// .arcmesh the import wave mints (source == MeshSource::Imported) opens in
// this same document. Its posture there is deliberately narrower than a
// generated mesh's: no Source combo (the source IS its model), no topology
// fields (the geometry is the cooked artifact's), no procedural preview
// (BuildMeshData has nothing to build -- the panel says "preview in the
// viewport" instead), and the material picker's clear NEVER erases slot 0
// (ClearPrimarySlotMaterial below: the slot array mirrors the artifact's
// slot table by position, so erasing would shift every later slot).
//
// Implements EditorDocument's five pure virtuals (EditorDocument.hpp:15-44);
// DocumentHost owns the open-document list, the asset-type -> factory
// routing, and the unsaved-close confirm modal.
