# Compares a Catch2 JSON report against the committed baselines.
#
# WHY: the suite's counts were tracked by hand in session notes, which is not a
# mechanism -- nothing failed when they silently dropped. A count that goes DOWN
# means coverage was lost; going UP is normal and rewrites nothing on its own
# (the baseline is committed deliberately, so a rise is a reviewed edit).
#
# `baseline` is OPTIONAL-ABSENT rather than zero-defaulted. UE's own TelemetryData
# defaults it to 0, which makes "no baseline" and "baseline of zero"
# indistinguishable -- the same defaults-are-not-measurements trap this repo has
# been bitten by before.
#
# -Invocation IS MANDATORY, AND IT IS PART OF THE KEY. A count is only
# comparable against a count taken THE SAME WAY. The six committed baselines
# were measured under `ArcaneTests.exe "~[gpu]"`; the Jenkins lane runs the
# suite UNFILTERED on an agent where [gpu] contributes ~62000 further
# assertions. Feeding one to the other left a permanent +62000 of slack, so a
# regression that deleted a thousand non-GPU assertions would still have
# reported a rise and exited 0 -- the guard was live and effectively inert on
# the lane that matters most. Making the invocation part of the match means a
# mismatched lane falls through to "NO BASELINE -- not checked", loudly, instead
# of passing on slack it never earned. Not-checked-loudly beats
# cannot-fail-silently.
