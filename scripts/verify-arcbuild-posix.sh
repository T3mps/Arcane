# verify-arcbuild-posix.sh -- the POSIX side of arcbuild's process runner
# (multibackend hardening Task 6, spec docs/specs/
# 2026-09-20-arcbuild-multibackend-hardening-design.md s6.4).
#
# arcbuild's ProcessRunner has two branches: CreateProcessW under _WIN32, and
# pipe/fork/dup2/chdir/execv/waitpid outside it. A Windows desk can build and
# run only the first, so this script is what a Linux/macOS host runs to
# validate the second. Deliberately /bin/sh (not bash): it must run on a bare
# CI container and on macOS's own shell without extra packages.
#
# Two stages, in increasing order of what they need from the host:
#
#   Stage 1 -- the PORTABLE COMPILE CONTRACT. Compiles the process-runner
#     translation unit and its arcbuild-local closure with a real POSIX
#     compiler. Process.cpp's include closure is arcbuild-local plus standard
#     headers only (no ArcaneCore, no engine, no third party), so this stage
#     needs nothing but a C++23 compiler and is the one stage that is expected
#     to pass TODAY. It is what proves the POSIX branch is real code the
#     platform's compiler accepts -- headers guarded correctly, no Win32
#     symbol leaking out of _WIN32, no POSIX header hiding inside it.
#
#   Stage 2 -- GENERATE, BUILD, TEST. premake5 gmake, then make arcbuild and
#     ArcaneTests, then ArcaneTests '[build]' (whose POSIX cases spawn /bin/sh
#     through the real runner: normal exit, 128 + signal, missing executable,
#     missing working directory, merged stdout/stderr, and argv passed through
#     unchanged). This stage additionally needs the wider Arcane Linux/macOS
#     port (ArcaneCore, SDL3/vcpkg, the renderer backends), which is a
#     separate milestone -- so until that lands, stage 2 is EXPECTED to fail
#     on something that has nothing to do with arcbuild. It fails loudly
#     rather than being skipped: a green run of this script means both stages
#     passed, and nothing weaker.
#
# Until stage 2 can run, the POSIX runner's RUNTIME behavior was validated by
# compiling Process.cpp/Compose.cpp/Output.cpp together with a throwaway main()
# that reproduces the [build] POSIX cases (BuildDriverTest.cpp) -- normal exit,
# 128 + signal, missing executable, missing working directory, merged
# stdout/stderr, argv passed through unchanged -- and running it on Linux. Task
# 6's report records that run; reproduce it the same way if this script's stage
# 2 is still blocked.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-arcbuild-posix.sh              # both stages
#   scripts/verify-arcbuild-posix.sh --syntax-only  # stage 1 only
#
# Environment:
#   CXX          compiler for stage 1 (default: c++)
#   PREMAKE5     premake5 binary for stage 2 (default: premake5 on PATH;
#                ThirdParty/premake5/ holds the Windows .exe only)
#   MAKE         make binary for stage 2 (default: make)
#   CONFIG       premake configuration for stage 2 (default: Debug)
#   PREMAKE_ACTION  premake action for stage 2 (default: gmake)
