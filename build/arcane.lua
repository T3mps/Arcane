--
-- An EXTERNAL project (one built OUTSIDE the Arcane.slnx workspace) consumes the
-- engine through this file. The "SDK" is the engine's own build output consumed
-- IN PLACE via the ARCANE_SDK env var (a packaged/installed SDK with a
-- multi-version registry is a later nicety -- spec 2026-07-22 S10/S12):
--
--   ARCANE_SDK  ->  the Arcane engine repo root (e.g. D:\dev\starworks\Arcane)

-- their Common lib and their test exes are the consumers; the recipe is lifted
-- from the engine's own ArcaneServer block in premake5.lua (the proven
-- Core-only host).
--
-- arcane_core_consumer() configures the CURRENT project: call it INSIDE a
-- `project` block, in place of `staticruntime`. It composes into whatever
-- shape the project has (ConsoleApp, StaticLib, a factory function) rather
-- than declaring one, because Core consumers do not share a shape the way
-- game modules do. It adds:
--   * staticruntime "off" -- /MD, one CRT heap across the DLL boundary (the
--     whole reason a consumer links a DLL instead of compiling Core from
--     source: objects allocated in ArcaneCore.dll are freed by the caller);
--   * the Core include root + the SDK-PRIVATE header-only deps a Core header
--     closure can reach (glm, Astra, enkiTS, Manifold2D, Mosaic). spdlog and
--     nlohmann are deliberately NOT added: a consumer vendors its own copies
--     (Aphelyon does, at the engine's versions), and two copies of a
--     header-only library on one include path is a version split waiting to
--     happen -- a consumer without them gets a clear missing-header error;
--   * the import lib + libdir;
--   * the engine's flavor contract, the same lines arcane_game_module
--     carries: /utf-8, /arch:AVX2 (ArcaneCore.dll is built AVX2 workspace-wide,
--     so the process already requires it -- matching keeps inline header
--     codegen identical across the boundary), and per-config runtime +
--     ARCANE_DEBUG / ARCANE_RELEASE+NDEBUG / ARCANE_DIST+NDEBUG so inline
--     header layouts under #ifndef NDEBUG agree with the DLL's.
-- It ends with `filter {}` so the caller's following lines are unfiltered.
--
-- arcane_core_stage_dll() adds the postbuild copy of ArcaneCore.dll beside an
-- exe's output (the dev bin layout; ArcaneRuntime's own postbuild is the
-- template). StaticLib consumers do not call it.
